## Learning Lab Activities

### Activity 1: Documentation Hunt Challenge (12 minutes)

**Objective:** Identify and organize required documentation for different loan types

**Instructions:**
1. You'll receive three borrower profiles, each seeking a different type of loan:
   - **Profile A - Destiny**: Seeking a $22,000 auto loan for a certified pre-owned SUV
   - **Profile B - Andre**: Applying for a $12,000 personal loan to consolidate credit card debt
   - **Profile C - Keisha**: Pursuing a $185,000 mortgage as a first-time homebuyer
2. For each profile, use the Documentation Checklist Builder to:
   - Select all required documents from the provided list
   - Identify which documents are "critical" (application cannot proceed without them) versus "supporting" (strengthen application but not mandatory)
   - Note any special documentation needs based on their unique circumstances (e.g., self-employment, co-signer, gift funds)
3. The tool will score your selections and provide feedback on:
   - Missing critical documents
   - Unnecessary documents included
   - Documents that need special explanations (large deposits, employment gaps, etc.)
4. For one profile, the borrower has a complicating factor:
   - Self-employment income (requires additional tax documents)
   - Recent job change (requires explanation letter)
   - Large bank deposit from family gift (requires gift letter)

   Identify which profile has which complication and add the appropriate documentation
5. Compare your documentation lists with a partner and discuss:
   - Which loan type required the most extensive documentation?
   - What documents were common across all three loan types?
   - What surprised you about the documentation requirements?

**Time Allocation:**
- Review profiles: 2 minutes
- Complete documentation checklists: 7 minutes
- Partner comparison and discussion: 3 minutes

### Activity 2: Application Completion Workshop (18 minutes)

**Objective:** Complete accurate loan applications using the Loan Application Simulator

**Instructions:**
1. Select one of three scenarios (your choice):
   - **Scenario A**: Mid-credit borrower seeking auto loan
   - **Scenario B**: Strong-credit borrower seeking personal loan
   - **Scenario C**: First-time homebuyer with moderate credit seeking mortgage
2. You'll receive a complete borrower financial profile including:
   - Personal information (name, address, employment)
   - Income details (salary, bonuses, other income)
   - Employment history and stability
   - Current debts and monthly obligations
   - Assets (savings, checking, investments)
   - Credit score and credit history summary
3. Using the Loan Application Simulator, complete the full loan application:
   - **Personal Information Section**: Enter name, address, SSN (simulated), date of birth
   - **Employment Section**: Current employer, position, length of employment, gross income
   - **Financial Section**: List all debts with balances and monthly payments; list all assets with current values
   - **Loan Request Section**: Amount requested, purpose, term preferred
   - **Additional Information**: Answer questions about bankruptcies, foreclosures, lawsuits, etc.
4. The simulator provides real-time feedback:
   - Red flags for missing required fields
   - Yellow warnings for incomplete or unclear information
   - Green confirmations for properly completed sections
   - Automatic calculation of debt-to-income ratio
5. Once you submit the application, the simulator provides:
   - Application Strength Score (0-100)
   - Approval Likelihood (Denied / Conditional / Likely / Strong)
   - Estimated interest rate range based on profile
   - Specific feedback on strengths and weaknesses
   - Recommendations for improvement
6. **Challenge**: Modify at least two factors in your borrower profile (pay down a debt, increase down payment, improve credit score) and resubmit to see how changes affect approval odds and interest rates

**Time Allocation:**
- Review borrower profile: 2 minutes
- Complete initial application: 10 minutes
- Review feedback and make improvements: 4 minutes
- Submit modified application and compare results: 2 minutes

### Activity 3: The Five C's Evaluation Station (12 minutes)

**Objective:** Analyze loan applications using lender perspective and the Five C's framework

**Instructions:**
1. You'll be assigned to evaluate one of three borrower scenarios as if you were a loan officer:
   - **Borrower 1 - Jamal**: 24 years old, $42,000 annual income, credit score 650, $8,000 in student loans, $3,000 in credit card debt, $2,500 in savings, seeking $18,000 auto loan with $1,500 down
   - **Borrower 2 - Sarah**: 28 years old, $55,000 annual income, credit score 740, $15,000 in student loans, $500 in credit card debt, $12,000 in savings, seeking $180,000 mortgage with 10% down
   - **Borrower 3 - Marcus**: 22 years old, $35,000 annual income, credit score 580, $12,000 in student loans, $4,500 in credit card debt, $800 in savings, seeking $8,000 personal loan for debt consolidation
2. Using the Application Strength Analyzer, evaluate your assigned borrower across the Five C's:
   - **Character**: Rate their credit history (1-10) based on credit score and payment patterns
   - **Capacity**: Calculate their debt-to-income ratio; assess whether they can afford the new payment
   - **Capital**: Evaluate their savings relative to the loan amount and down payment
   - **Collateral**: For secured loans, assess loan-to-value ratio and collateral adequacy
   - **Conditions**: Consider the loan purpose and whether it makes financial sense
3. For each C, assign a score of 1-10 and provide specific justification
4. The tool calculates an overall creditworthiness score and provides a recommendation:
   - **Approve at Premium Terms**: Strong across all five C's
   - **Approve at Standard Terms**: Generally strong with minor weaknesses
   - **Approve with Conditions**: Moderate concerns requiring mitigation (higher rate, co-signer, larger down payment)
   - **Deny**: Significant concerns across multiple C's
5. Form groups of three (one student who evaluated each borrower) and share your evaluations:
   - Which C was strongest for your borrower?
   - Which C was weakest?
   - What specific actions could your borrower take to improve their approval odds?
6. **Group Discussion**: Which of the three borrowers would you most likely approve if you were a lender? Why? What conditions or terms would you impose on the other two?

**Time Allocation:**
- Review borrower scenario: 2 minutes
- Complete Five C's evaluation: 6 minutes
- Form groups and share evaluations: 3 minutes
- Group discussion on lending decisions: 1 minute

### Activity 4: Creditworthiness Improvement Planning (8 minutes)

**Objective:** Develop actionable strategies to strengthen future loan applications

**Instructions:**
1. Using the Creditworthiness Improvement Planner, assess your own financial situation:
   - Estimate your current credit score (or use "building credit" if you have none)
   - List your monthly income
   - List all current debts and monthly payments
   - Calculate your current debt-to-income ratio
   - Note your current savings level
2. Select a loan you might realistically need within the next 2-3 years:
   - Auto loan for first or replacement vehicle
   - Personal loan for major expense
   - Student loan for education
   - Mortgage for first home
3. The tool will analyze your current position and identify:
   - **Strengths**: Factors working in your favor
   - **Weaknesses**: Areas that might prevent approval or result in poor terms
   - **Opportunities**: Realistic improvements you can make
   - **Threats**: Potential obstacles or red flags
4. Create a 6-12 month improvement plan with specific, measurable actions:
   - **Credit Building**: Steps to improve or establish credit (pay all bills on time, reduce credit utilization, become authorized user, etc.)
   - **Debt Reduction**: Target specific debts to pay off or pay down to improve DTI
   - **Savings Building**: Monthly savings target to build down payment and reserves
   - **Employment Stability**: Maintain current position or plan strategic career moves
   - **Documentation Preparation**: Gather and organize documents you'll need
5. The planner estimates:
   - Projected credit score improvement (if actions are followed)
   - Projected DTI improvement
   - How these improvements affect approval likelihood and estimated interest rates
   - Potential dollar savings over the life of the loan from better terms
6. **Reflection**: What's the single most impactful action you could take in the next 6 months to strengthen your future loan applications?

**Time Allocation:**
- Input current financial situation: 3 minutes
- Review analysis and create improvement plan: 4 minutes
- Individual reflection on most impactful action: 1 minute

## Reflection & Wrap-up (5 minutes)

**Group Discussion Questions:**
1. What was the most surprising insight from today's activities about the loan application process?
2. How prepared do you feel to complete a loan application after this hands-on practice?
3. What documentation do you need to start gathering now to be prepared for future loan applications?
4. What's one specific action you'll take in the next month to improve your creditworthiness?

**Individual Reflection:**
Take 2 minutes to write responses to:
- One thing I learned about loan applications that I didn't know before today
- One action I will take in the next 30 days to prepare for future borrowing
- One resource or tool from today that I will use when I actually apply for a loan

## Key Takeaways

By the end of this learning lab, you should be able to:

1. **Identify Required Documentation**: Know exactly what paperwork you need for different types of loan applications and how to gather and organize these documents efficiently

2. **Complete Accurate Applications**: Fill out comprehensive loan applications with confidence, understanding what information lenders need and why each section matters

3. **Evaluate Creditworthiness**: Assess your own application strength using the Five C's framework and identify specific areas for improvement before applying

4. **Calculate Key Metrics**: Determine your debt-to-income ratio, loan-to-value ratio, and other critical calculations that lenders use to evaluate applications

5. **Develop Improvement Strategies**: Create actionable plans to strengthen weak areas—improving credit scores, reducing debt, building savings—to secure better loan terms

6. **Understand Lender Perspective**: Think like a loan officer when assessing risk, helping you anticipate concerns and address them proactively in your applications

7. **Prepare Strategically**: Build a timeline for major purchases that includes months of preparation to improve creditworthiness rather than applying reactively when unprepared

The loan application process rewards preparation, organization, and strategic financial management. The skills practiced today—documentation gathering, accurate application completion, creditworthiness evaluation, and improvement planning—directly translate to better approval odds and thousands of dollars in savings over your borrowing lifetime. Every loan you'll apply for in your life will benefit from the understanding gained in this learning lab.
