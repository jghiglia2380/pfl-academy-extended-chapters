# L-57 Teacher Guide: Loan Application Process and Requirements - Day 2 Learning Lab

## Learning Lab Overview
Today's session transforms yesterday's conceptual knowledge into hands-on application skills. Students work through four activity stations where they identify required documentation, complete realistic loan applications, evaluate applications using lender criteria, and develop personal creditworthiness improvement plans. The format is highly interactive—students spend approximately 50 minutes actively working with digital tools and realistic scenarios, with minimal direct instruction. Your role shifts from lecturer to facilitator, circulating among students to answer questions, provide guidance, and ensure productive engagement with the activities.

## Learning Objectives
- Complete a comprehensive loan application with accuracy and required documentation
- Identify and gather the necessary documentation for different types of loan applications
- Understand how lenders evaluate creditworthiness and assess loan applications
- Analyze factors that increase or decrease likelihood of loan approval
- Develop strategies to strengthen loan applications and improve approval odds

## Detailed Facilitation Guide

### Setup & Introduction (5 minutes)
**0:00-0:05**

**Your Role:** Set expectations for today's hands-on format; ensure students can access all tools.

**Script:**
"Yesterday we learned what lenders look for in loan applications and how the Five C's framework guides approval decisions. Today is all about practice. You'll complete real loan applications, evaluate them like a lender would, and create plans to strengthen your future applications. This is 90% you working and 10% me guiding. My job is to circulate, answer questions, and help you when you're stuck."

**Logistics:**
1. **Quick Review** (2 minutes): Ask 3-4 students to share one key concept from yesterday:
   - "What does DTI stand for and why does it matter?"
   - "Name one of the Five C's"
   - "What's one document you'll need for most loan applications?"

2. **Tool Access Check** (2 minutes):
   - "Everyone pull up the Documentation Checklist Builder"
   - Ensure all students can access it; troubleshoot connectivity issues
   - Show where to find the other three tools

3. **Today's Flow** (1 minute):
   - Explain the four activities
   - Set expectation: work at your own pace, but aim to complete all four
   - Emphasize that making mistakes is part of learning—the tools provide feedback

**Transition:** "Let's start with Activity 1, where you'll identify what documentation is needed for different types of loans."

---

### Activity 1: Documentation Hunt Challenge (12 minutes)
**0:05-0:17**

**Activity Overview:**
Students receive three borrower profiles (each seeking a different loan type) and must identify all required documentation using the Documentation Checklist Builder.

**Learning Objective:** Understand that documentation needs vary by loan type and borrower circumstances.

**Your Role: Facilitator & Question Answerer**

**Circulation Strategy:**
Move around the classroom continuously. Don't stay at your desk. Position yourself where you can see multiple students' screens.

**Coaching Tips as You Circulate:**

**What to Look For:**
- Are students selecting documents at random, or reading the profiles carefully?
- Are they identifying "critical" vs. "supporting" documents correctly?
- Are they catching the complications (self-employment, job change, gift deposit)?

**Common Issues and How to Address:**

**Issue 1: Student selects too many documents**
- **Coaching:** "Would a lender really need your birth certificate for an auto loan? Focus on what they need to verify income, identity, and debts."

**Issue 2: Student misses critical documents**
- **Coaching (Don't just tell them):** "The profile says Destiny is employed. How would a lender verify that? What document proves income?"

**Issue 3: Student doesn't identify special circumstances**
- **Coaching:** "Read Andre's employment section carefully. Is there anything unusual about his job situation that might require extra documentation?"

**Issue 4: Student finishes very quickly (probably guessed)**
- **Coaching:** "I see you're done. Walk me through why you selected bank statements for the personal loan application." (This reveals whether they understand or guessed)

**Key Points to Reinforce:**
- **Auto loans** need proof of income, residence, ID, and vehicle information (VIN, purchase agreement)
- **Personal loans** need the same plus more extensive income verification (tax returns if self-employed)
- **Mortgages** need everything plus extensive asset verification (2-3 months bank statements, retirement accounts, gift letters for down payment)

**Answers to Provide When Asked:**
- **"Do I need bank statements for an auto loan?"** "Usually yes—2 months minimum to verify down payment savings."
- **"What's a gift letter?"** "When family gives you money for a down payment, lenders need written confirmation it's a gift, not a loan you have to repay."
- **"Why do self-employed people need tax returns?"** "No pay stubs, so lenders verify income through tax returns—usually 2 years to show consistent income."

**Partner Comparison Phase (final 3 minutes):**
Facilitate meaningful comparison:
- "Don't just compare answers—discuss WHY you selected each document."
- "Did you and your partner disagree on anything? Why?"
- "Which loan type required the most documentation? Why does that make sense?"

**Transition:** "Now you know what documentation you'd need. Let's actually fill out loan applications."

### Activity 2: Application Completion Workshop (18 minutes)
**0:17-0:35**

**Activity Overview:**
Students complete full loan applications using the Loan Application Simulator, receive feedback, and modify scenarios to improve approval odds.

**This is the longest and most complex activity—manage time carefully.**

**Your Role: Coach & Troubleshooter**

**Circulation Strategy:**
This activity requires intensive support. Students will have questions about where information goes, what fields mean, and how to interpret feedback.

**Coaching Tips as You Circulate:**

**Opening Phase: Profile Review & Initial Application (0:17-0:29, 12 minutes)**

**What to Look For:**
- Are students reading the borrower profile carefully before starting?
- Are they transferring information accurately into application fields?
- Are they calculating DTI correctly?
- Are they understanding real-time feedback from the simulator?

**Common Questions and How to Respond:**

**"Where do I put the car payment they already have?"**
- **Coaching:** "Look for the section on current debts or liabilities. You'll list each debt separately with its monthly payment."

**"What's 'gross monthly income'?"**
- **Coaching:** "Before taxes and deductions. If they make $45,000/year, divide by 12. What's that?"

**"The simulator says my DTI is too high. What do I do?"**
- **Coaching:** "You can't change the borrower's actual situation, but look at the scenario. Could they pay off any small debts before applying? What would that do to their DTI?"

**"What's loan-to-value ratio?"**
- **Coaching:** "For a car loan, it's the loan amount divided by the car's value. If they're borrowing $20,000 for a $25,000 car, what's the LTV?" (80%)

**Key Points to Reinforce:**
- Accuracy matters—lenders verify everything
- Missing fields trigger red flags that delay or deny applications
- DTI is calculated automatically, but understanding the math helps you improve it
- Pre-populated fields (like employer contact info) must be complete

**Red Flags to Watch For:**

**Red Flag: Student entering obviously wrong information**
Example: Putting "$45,000" in monthly income instead of annual
- **Intervention:** "Wait—look at that income number. Does anyone make $45,000 per month? Check whether it's asking for annual or monthly."

**Red Flag: Student skipping required fields**
- **Intervention:** "The simulator is flagging something in red. What does the error message say? What field did you leave blank?"

**Red Flag: Student not reading feedback**
The simulator provides detailed feedback—many students submit and ignore it
- **Intervention:** "You submitted—great! Now read what the lender's feedback says. What's your Application Strength Score? What does it recommend improving?"

**Modification Phase: Improving Applications (0:29-0:35, 6 minutes)**

This is where deep learning happens. Students must understand cause-and-effect.

**What to Look For:**
- Are students making strategic changes or random ones?
- Do they understand how each change affects the score?
- Are they applying concepts from yesterday (Five C's)?

**Coaching Questions to Ask:**
- "Your first submission got a 65 strength score. What one change would have the biggest impact?" (Usually: increase down payment, reduce DTI by paying off a debt, or improve credit score)
- "You increased the down payment from $1,500 to $3,500. What happened to the LTV? How did that affect approval likelihood?"
- "The credit score improved from 640 to 680. What happened to the estimated interest rate range?"

**Powerful Teaching Moments:**
Watch for students who discover key relationships:
- **Down payment impact**: "Whoa, adding $2,000 to down payment dropped my interest rate!"
  - **You:** "Yes! Why? Lower LTV means less risk for the lender. Share that with the person next to you."

- **DTI impact**: "Paying off the $3,000 credit card raised my approval from 'conditional' to 'likely'!"
  - **You:** "Exactly. That $3,000 debt had a $150 monthly payment. Eliminating it freed up payment capacity. This is why we pay off debts before taking on new ones."

**Students Who Finish Early:**
- **Challenge:** "Try a different loan type and compare. Is it easier to get approved for an auto loan or personal loan? Why?"
- **Challenge:** "Take a 'weak' borrower profile and create a 6-month improvement plan that would get them approved."

**Transition:** "You've experienced applying as a borrower. Now let's flip it—evaluate applications like a lender would."

---

### Activity 3: The Five C's Evaluation Station (12 minutes)
**0:35-0:47**

**Activity Overview:**
Students evaluate three different borrowers using the Five C's framework and make lending decisions.

**Learning Objective:** Understand lender perspective and how the Five C's drive approval decisions.

**Your Role: Perspective Coach**

**This activity requires a mindset shift—students must think like lenders, not borrowers.**

**Circulation Strategy:**
Students work individually first, then form groups of three. You'll need to circulate during both phases.

**Individual Evaluation Phase (0:35-0:41, 6 minutes)**

**What to Look For:**
- Are students actually scoring each C separately (1-10)?
- Are they providing justifications, or just guessing numbers?
- Do they understand what each C measures?

**Coaching Tips:**

**For Character (Credit History):**
- **If they ask:** "How do I score character if I only have their credit score?"
  - **Coaching:** "Credit score quantifies character. 740+ is excellent (8-10), 670-739 is good (6-7), 620-669 is fair (4-5), below 620 is poor (1-3)."

**For Capacity (Ability to Repay):**
- **If they struggle:** "Calculate DTI first. What's the borrower's current DTI? If the loan is approved, what would it become? Can they afford the new payment?"
  - **Coaching:** "DTI below 20% is excellent, 20-30% is good, 30-40% is manageable but tight, above 40% is concerning."

**For Capital (Financial Resources):**
- **If they ask:** "What counts as capital?"
  - **Coaching:** "Savings, down payment, investments, reserves. Compare their savings to what they're borrowing. If they're borrowing $10,000 but only have $800 saved, that's risky (low capital). If they have $5,000 saved, that's stronger."

**For Collateral (Secured Loans):**
- **Reminder:** "Only applies to secured loans. For the auto loan and mortgage, calculate LTV. For the personal loan (unsecured), this doesn't apply—mark N/A."

**For Conditions (Loan Purpose):**
- **If they ask:** "How do I score this?"
  - **Coaching:** "Does the loan make financial sense? Borrowing for a reliable car to get to work = good conditions. Borrowing for debt consolidation when already struggling with debt = questionable conditions."

**Common Mistakes and How to Address:**

**Mistake: Rating all C's the same**
Example: Student gives all 7's across the board
- **Intervention:** "Most borrowers have strengths and weaknesses. What's this borrower's strongest C? What's their weakest? The scores should reflect that."

**Mistake: Ignoring provided data**
Example: Student scores Capital as 8/10 when profile shows only $800 in savings for a $10,000 loan
- **Intervention:** "Look at the savings relative to the loan amount. $800 saved for a $10,000 loan—is that strong capital?"

**Mistake: Being too generous or too harsh**
Some students approve everyone; others deny everyone
- **Intervention:** "Lenders want to approve people—they make money from interest. But they can't approve someone who can't repay. Balance risk with opportunity."

**Group Discussion Phase (0:41-0:47, 6 minutes)**

**Forming Groups:**
Ensure each group has three students who evaluated three different borrowers (Jamal, Sarah, Marcus).

**Facilitation During Group Discussions:**

**Listen for Quality Dialogue:**
Good discussion: "I gave Jamal a 5 for Character because his 650 credit score is fair but not strong. He has some credit issues in his past."
Poor discussion: "I gave him a 5." (no justification)

**If you hear poor discussion:**
- **Intervention:** "Don't just share scores—explain WHY. What specific part of Jamal's profile led you to that score?"

**Key Question to Pose to Groups:**
"If you could only approve ONE of these three borrowers, which would it be? Why? What conditions would you put on the other two to make them approvable?"

**Listen for Misconceptions:**
- **Misconception:** "Sarah has the most debt, so she's the riskiest."
  - **Correction:** "Look at DTI, not absolute debt amount. She makes $55,000 and has $15,500 in total debt—most of which is low-rate student loans. Her DTI is manageable. Compare that to Marcus, who makes less and has high-interest debt."

- **Misconception:** "Marcus should be denied because of his 580 credit score."
  - **Discussion Point:** "He might be denied, but are there conditions that could make him approvable? Co-signer? Larger down payment? Secured credit card to build credit first?"

**Transition:** "You've evaluated others. Now let's create a plan to strengthen YOUR future applications."

### Activity 4: Creditworthiness Improvement Planning (8 minutes)
**0:47-0:55**

**Activity Overview:**
Students assess their own financial situation and create actionable 6-12 month improvement plans.

**This is personal and potentially sensitive. Some students may feel uncomfortable.**

**Your Role: Supportive Coach & Realism Checker**

**Sensitivity Considerations:**
- Some students have limited income, poor family credit situations, or feel behind peers
- Frame everything as opportunity for improvement, not judgment of current state
- Respect privacy—students should not be required to share personal financial details publicly

**Circulation Strategy:**
Position yourself where you can see screens but provide privacy for individual work.

**Coaching Tips:**

**For Students with No Credit History:**
Many students won't have credit yet—this feels like a deficit but isn't
- **Coaching:** "No credit is different from bad credit. You're starting from zero, which is normal. Your plan should focus on establishing credit: becoming an authorized user on a family member's card, getting a secured credit card, or taking out a small credit-builder loan."

**For Students with Limited Income:**
Some students aren't employed or work part-time minimum wage
- **Coaching:** "Focus on what you CAN control: building any savings, avoiding debt, establishing credit responsibly. When your income increases, you'll have a strong foundation."

**For Students from Families with Poor Credit:**
Some fear they'll inherit their family's financial problems
- **Coaching:** "Your credit is yours alone. Your parents' credit score doesn't affect yours unless you're a co-signer on their accounts. You have the power to build strong credit regardless of family history."

**What to Look For:**

**Good Plans Include:**
- Specific, measurable actions ("Save $50/month" not "Save more money")
- Realistic timelines (6-12 months)
- Multiple strategies addressing different C's
- Recognition of current strengths AND weaknesses

**Weak Plans Include:**
- Vague goals ("Get better credit")
- Unrealistic actions ("Save $1,000/month" when income is $800/month)
- Single-focus (only focuses on credit score, ignores savings or debt)

**Coaching Questions to Ask:**

**For Students Struggling to Identify Actions:**
- "The tool showed some weaknesses. Pick the one that's easiest to improve in 6 months. What specific action addresses that?"
- "If you were applying for an auto loan in 2 years, what would worry you most about your current situation? What can you do now to fix that?"

**For Students with Unrealistic Plans:**
- "You said you'd save $500/month, but your income is $600/month. Is that realistic? What's a number you could actually achieve consistently?"

**For Students Being Too Modest:**
- "You said you'd save $20/month. Over 12 months, that's $240. Could you do $50/month if you skipped one or two small purchases each month? That's $600/year, which could be a down payment."

**Powerful Teaching Moments:**

Watch for students who have revelations:
- **"I didn't realize paying off my $500 credit card balance would help this much!"**
  - **You:** "Yes! High credit utilization hurts your score. Paying it off could raise your score 20-30 points. And the $25/month you were paying can now go to savings."

- **"The calculator says improving my score from 620 to 680 could save me $3,000 on a car loan!"**
  - **You:** "Exactly. That's why six months of credit improvement is worth it before applying. Share that with the class."

**For Students Who Finish Early:**
- **Challenge:** "Calculate the dollar impact. If improving your credit score gets you a 1% better interest rate on a $20,000 car loan, how much money does that save over 5 years?" (Approximately $600)
- **Reflection:** "What's the FIRST action you'll take this week to start your improvement plan?"

**Final Minute (0:54-0:55):**
Ask 2-3 students to share (voluntarily): "What's one action from your improvement plan you're committing to?"

Examples students might share:
- "I'm going to ask my mom if I can be an authorized user on her credit card."
- "I'm setting up automatic transfer of $40/month to savings."
- "I'm going to check my credit report for the first time."

**Affirm these commitments:** "Those are excellent first steps. Small actions now create big advantages later."

## Reflection & Wrap-up (5 minutes)
**0:55-0:55**

**Your Role: Synthesizer & Motivator**

**NOTE:** Time is very tight. You likely have just 2-3 minutes for this discussion. Keep it focused.

**Group Discussion (2-3 minutes):**

Ask 2-3 of these questions based on time:

1. "What was the most surprising insight from today's activities?"
   - *Listen for:* Understanding how much small improvements matter, realizing documentation is extensive, discovering lenders' perspective

2. "How prepared do you feel NOW to complete a loan application compared to before this class?"
   - *Listen for:* Increased confidence, awareness of what to expect, reduced anxiety

3. "What's one thing you'll do differently when you apply for a real loan because of what you learned today?"
   - *Listen for:* Check credit first, gather documentation early, improve creditworthiness before applying, shop lenders, understand the Five C's

**Individual Reflection (2 minutes):**
"Take 60 seconds to write down three things:"
1. One thing I learned about loan applications I didn't know before
2. One action I'll take in the next 30 days to prepare for future borrowing
3. One resource or tool from today I'll use when I actually apply for a loan

**Closing Message (Final 30 seconds):**
"The loan application process doesn't have to be intimidating. You now know what lenders want, how they evaluate you, what documentation you need, and how to strengthen your applications. The difference between being prepared and unprepared can mean thousands of dollars saved over a loan's lifetime—or the difference between approval and denial. The work you put in now—building credit, saving money, reducing debt—pays off when you need to borrow. You have the knowledge. Now take action."

## Assessment & Monitoring

### Formative Assessment During Activities

**Activity 1 (Documentation Hunt):**
- Circulate and check student selections—are they identifying the right documents?
- Listen to partner discussions—do they understand WHY each document is needed?
- Quick check: "Raise your hand if mortgages required more documentation than auto loans." (Should be everyone)

**Activity 2 (Application Completion):**
- Monitor Application Strength Scores—most students should achieve 60-80 on first attempt
- After modifications, scores should improve to 70-90
- Check that students understand feedback, not just clicking randomly

**Activity 3 (Five C's Evaluation):**
- Review a few student evaluations—are scores justified?
- Listen to group discussions—quality dialogue indicates understanding
- Ask lending decision question—groups should identify Sarah as strongest borrower

**Activity 4 (Improvement Planning):**
- Glance at plans—specific actions or vague goals?
- Are plans realistic or aspirational?
- Do plans address actual weaknesses or generic advice?

### Red Flags to Address

**Red Flag: Student completing activities very quickly without engagement**
- **Likely Issue:** Clicking randomly to finish fast
- **Intervention:** "Walk me through how you decided on that answer. What led you to that conclusion?"

**Red Flag: Student stuck and not progressing**
- **Likely Issue:** Technology problem, lack of understanding, or reading difficulty
- **Intervention:** Sit with them briefly, diagnose the issue, provide targeted support

**Red Flag: Student disengaged or off-task**
- **Likely Issue:** Content feels irrelevant, too easy, or too hard
- **Intervention:** "What's challenging about this activity? How can I help?" or "You seem to get this quickly—try the advanced challenge."

**Red Flag: Student visibly upset or frustrated**
- **Likely Issue:** Personal financial stress, family situation, or feeling overwhelmed
- **Intervention:** Private conversation: "I noticed this seems to be hitting close to home. Want to take a break or talk about it?" Offer connection to school counselor if needed.

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Advanced Students
- **Documentation Hunt:** Add a fourth complicated scenario (self-employed borrower seeking mortgage with gift funds and investment income)
- **Application Completion:** Complete applications for all three loan types and create comparison analysis
- **Five C's Evaluation:** Evaluate a borderline borrower and write a detailed recommendation memo to a lending committee
- **Improvement Planning:** Create plans for all three borrowers from Activity 3, not just themselves

### For Struggling Students
- **Documentation Hunt:** Start with just one loan type (auto loan), master it, then add others
- **Application Completion:** Provide a partially completed application as a guide; focus on one scenario
- **Five C's Evaluation:** Evaluate just one borrower with teacher support; simplified scoring rubric
- **Improvement Planning:** Use a template with fill-in-the-blank format rather than open-ended

### For English Language Learners
- **Pre-teach vocabulary:** underwriting, collateral, capital, co-signer, DTI
- **Provide glossary:** Loan terms with definitions available during activities
- **Visual aids:** Use flowcharts showing application process
- **Allow extra time:** Extend deadlines for completion if needed
- **Translation tools:** Permit use of translation apps for complex terminology

### For Students with Diverse Needs
- **Financial trauma:** Some students from families with foreclosures, repossessions, or predatory lending experiences—approach with sensitivity
- **Immigrant families:** May have different credit systems in home countries; U.S. credit building starts from zero
- **Low-income students:** Activities assume access to banking, savings, credit—some students may not have these yet; frame as future preparation
- **Students with disabilities:** Ensure digital tools are accessible (screen reader compatible, keyboard navigation)

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Technology Issues

**Problem: Digital tool won't load**
- **Solution 1:** Refresh browser, clear cache, try different browser
- **Solution 2:** Check school network/firewall—tools may be blocked
- **Solution 3:** Have backup paper-based version of activities
- **Solution 4:** Students pair up and share devices

**Problem: Students can't log in**
- **Solution:** Verify correct login credentials; reset passwords if needed; use guest/demo accounts if available

**Problem: Tool is extremely slow**
- **Solution:** Check how many students are accessing simultaneously; stagger access if server is overloaded

### Engagement Issues

**Problem: Students rushing through without reading**
- **Solution:** Implement checkpoint questions—students must answer 2-3 questions about what they learned from each activity before moving to the next

**Problem: Activities taking much longer than planned**
- **Solution:** Prioritize Activities 2 & 4 (most important); make Activities 1 & 3 optional or homework

**Problem: Students don't see relevance**
- **Solution:** Share quick real-world story: "My friend bought a car without preparing. They paid 12% interest instead of 6% because of a 620 credit score. Over 5 years, that cost them $4,000. Thirty minutes of preparation could have saved $4,000."

### Classroom Management Issues

**Problem: Some students finish very early, others lag behind**
- **Solution:** Have extension challenges ready for fast finishers; pair them with students who need support (peer tutoring)

**Problem: Off-topic conversation**
- **Solution:** Refocus: "I hear you talking about [off-topic thing]. Let's refocus on the application you're completing."

**Problem: Students sharing answers instead of working independently**
- **Solution:** Clarify: "Discussing strategy is fine. Copying exact answers isn't. Make sure you understand WHY, not just WHAT."

## State-Specific Teaching Notes

When facilitating this learning lab, enhance local relevance by:

### Local Resources to Reference

- **Credit Unions:** Mention local credit unions known for working with first-time borrowers:
  - "{{LOCAL_CREDIT_UNION_NAME}} has a first-time auto buyer program with education requirements and competitive rates."

- **Consumer Protection:** Reference state consumer protection office:
  - "If you ever face predatory lending or unfair practices, {{STATE_NAME}} has consumer protection resources at {{STATE_CONSUMER_PROTECTION_URL}}."

- **Nonprofit Credit Counseling:** Identify local HUD-approved credit counseling agencies:
  - "{{LOCAL_NONPROFIT_NAME}} offers free credit counseling if you need help preparing loan applications or improving credit."

### State-Specific Examples

**For States with Specific Lending Regulations:**
- Some states cap interest rates, ban certain fees, or have unique consumer protections
- Example: "In {{STATE_NAME}}, payday lenders are banned/regulated, which protects you from predatory high-interest loans."

**For States with First-Time Homebuyer Programs:**
- "{{STATE_NAME}} has a first-time homebuyer program offering down payment assistance and lower rates for qualifying borrowers."

**For States with Unique Tax Implications:**
- Some states have different rules on mortgage interest deductibility or student loan interest
- Mention if relevant: "In {{STATE_NAME}}, [specific tax advantage] may affect your borrowing decisions."

---

## Extension & Enrichment

### For Homework or Follow-Up

1. **Real Documentation Hunt:** Have students actually gather the documentation they'd need for a loan:
   - If employed: Collect recent pay stubs
   - Obtain a copy of their credit report (if 18+, free at annualcreditreport.com)
   - List all current debts and monthly payments
   - Calculate their actual DTI

2. **Lender Research:** Compare requirements and rates from three different lenders (bank, credit union, online lender) for the same loan type

3. **Interview Assignment:** Interview a family member or trusted adult about their experience applying for a loan—what was challenging, what they wish they'd known

4. **Credit Building Plan:** Create a detailed 12-month plan to establish or improve credit, with monthly milestones

### Extension Activities for Fast Finishers

1. **Comparative Analysis:** Research how loan application requirements differ for:
   - FHA vs. conventional mortgages
   - Federal vs. private student loans
   - Bank vs. credit union auto loans

2. **Predatory Lending Research:** Investigate payday loans, title loans, or rent-to-own schemes—calculate APR and compare to traditional lending

3. **Credit Score Simulation:** Use a credit score simulator to see how different actions (opening new card, paying off debt, missing payment) affect scores over time

## Teacher Reflection

After facilitating this learning lab, consider:

1. **Time Management:** Did students complete all four activities? If not, which should be shortened or extended?
