3. Access the Investment Type Analyzer and familiarize yourself with the interface
4. Have a calculator or spreadsheet ready for calculations

## Learning Lab Activities

### Activity 1: Investment Type Characteristics Deep Dive
**Time: 15 minutes**
**Objective:** Master the key characteristics that distinguish different investment types

**Instructions:**

**Part A: Characteristic Mapping (8 minutes)**
1. Open the Investment Characteristics Comparison Chart
2. For each investment type (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs), rate on a scale of 1-5:
   - Potential Return (1 = low, 5 = high)
   - Risk Level (1 = very safe, 5 = volatile)
   - Liquidity (1 = hard to sell, 5 = easy to sell)
   - Complexity (1 = simple, 5 = complex)
   - Minimum Investment (1 = very low, 5 = high)
   - Income Generation (1 = no income, 5 = steady income)

3. For each category, identify which investment type scores highest and lowest

**Part B: Real Examples Analysis (7 minutes)**
Using real-world data provided in the analyzer:
1. Compare three specific investments:
   - Individual stock: Apple (AAPL)
   - Bond fund: Vanguard Total Bond Market (BND)
   - Stock ETF: Vanguard S&P 500 (VOO)

2. For each investment, record:
   - Current price
   - 1-year return percentage
   - Dividend/yield payment
   - Expense ratio (for funds)
   - Year-to-date performance

3. Rank them from highest to lowest risk based on volatility data provided

4. Calculate: If you invested $1,000 in each one year ago, what would each be worth today based on historical performance?

**Checkpoint Questions:**
- Which investment showed the highest return over the past year? Which showed the most volatility?
- How much did fees (expense ratios) cost an investor with $10,000 invested for one year in each fund?
- Based on these characteristics, which investment would you choose for a retirement account you won't touch for 30 years? Why?

The simulator presents four economic scenarios. For each, predict whether stocks or bonds will perform better, then check the historical data:

1. **Scenario: Strong Economic Growth (GDP +4%)**
   - Your prediction: Stocks or Bonds?
   - Historical data shows: ___________
   - Explanation: ___________

2. **Scenario: Recession (GDP -2%)**
   - Your prediction: Stocks or Bonds?
   - Historical data shows: ___________
   - Explanation: ___________

3. **Scenario: High Inflation (5% annual)**
   - Your prediction: Stocks or Bonds?
   - Historical data shows: ___________
   - Explanation: ___________

4. **Scenario: Rising Interest Rates (Fed raises rates 2%)**
   - Your prediction: Stocks or Bonds?
   - Historical data shows: ___________
   - Explanation: ___________

**Part B: Long-Term Perspective (6 minutes)**
1. Use the simulator to compare $10,000 invested in 1993 in:
   - 100% stocks (S&P 500 index)
   - 100% bonds (U.S. Treasury bonds)
   - 60% stocks / 40% bonds (balanced)

2. Record the ending values after 30 years (through 2023):
   - All-stock portfolio: $__________
   - All-bond portfolio: $__________
   - Balanced portfolio: $__________

3. Note the worst single-year loss for each:
   - All-stock worst year: __________ (year: _____)
   - All-bond worst year: __________ (year: _____)
   - Balanced worst year: __________ (year: _____)

**Reflection:** Would you have been able to stay invested through the worst year's losses? How does this inform your risk tolerance?

### Activity 3: Mutual Fund vs. ETF Comparison Challenge
**Time: 12 minutes**
**Objective:** Understand practical differences between mutual funds and ETFs through direct comparison

**Instructions:**

**Part A: Head-to-Head Comparison (7 minutes)**
Compare two similar investments tracking the S&P 500:
- Mutual Fund: Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX)
- ETF: SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY)

For each, research and record:
1. Expense ratio (annual fee %)

   - [ ] Medium-term goal (home, education)
   - [ ] Short-term savings (car, emergency fund)

2. My investment time horizon is:
   - [ ] More than 20 years
   - [ ] 10-20 years
   - [ ] 5-10 years
   - [ ] Less than 5 years

3. If my investments lost 20% in one year, I would:
   - [ ] Stay calm and keep investing (high risk tolerance)
   - [ ] Feel nervous but probably stay invested (moderate tolerance)
   - [ ] Likely sell to prevent further losses (low tolerance)

4. My current financial stability:
   - [ ] Stable income, emergency fund established, minimal debt
   - [ ] Stable income but building emergency fund
   - [ ] Income uncertain or significant debt to address

**Part B: Decision Tree Application (6 minutes)**
Based on your profile, work through the Investment Decision Framework:

**Step 1:** Do you have an emergency fund (3-6 months expenses)?
- If NO → Priority is building cash savings before investing
- If YES → Proceed to Step 2

**Step 2:** What is your primary time horizon?
- If less than 5 years → Conservative allocation (bonds/cash focus)
- If 5-15 years → Moderate allocation (balanced stocks/bonds)
- If more than 15 years → Growth allocation (stock focus)

**Step 3:** What is your risk tolerance?
- High tolerance → Can increase stock allocation by 10-20%
- Moderate tolerance → Stick with recommended allocation
- Low tolerance → Decrease stock allocation by 10-20%

**Step 4:** What is your investment experience level?
- Beginner → Start with broad index funds/ETFs
- Intermediate → Can add sector funds or some individual stocks
- Advanced → Comfortable with more complex strategies

**Your Investment Recommendation:**
Based on this framework:

## Key Takeaways

Through today's hands-on exploration, you've gained practical experience with:

1. **Investment Characteristics:** Different investment types serve different purposes. Stocks offer growth potential with volatility; bonds provide stability with lower returns; funds offer instant diversification; ETFs combine fund benefits with lower costs.

2. **Performance Patterns:** Stocks and bonds react differently to economic conditions. Stocks excel during growth periods, bonds provide stability during downturns. A balanced approach smooths volatility while capturing long-term growth.

3. **Fee Impact:** Small differences in fees compound dramatically over time. A 1% fee difference can cost tens of thousands of dollars over decades. Low-cost index funds and ETFs preserve more of your returns.

4. **Goal Alignment:** The right investment depends on your goal, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Retirement accounts can accept stock volatility for long-term growth; near-term goals need stable bonds; medium-term goals benefit from balanced approaches.

5. **Getting Started:** You don't need to be an expert to invest effectively. Simple portfolios of low-cost index funds, matched to your time horizon and risk tolerance, outperform most complex strategies. Starting early and contributing consistently matters more than perfect investment selection.

**Next Steps:** Consider opening a retirement account (401k, IRA) or investment account through a low-cost brokerage, starting with an amount you can comfortably invest monthly. Even $50-100/month invested consistently in a diversified portfolio can grow substantially over time through compound returns.

**Before Next Class:** Review your investment profile and decision framework from Activity 5. Research one low-cost brokerage (Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab) and explore their investment options. Come prepared to discuss any questions about getting started with actual investing.
