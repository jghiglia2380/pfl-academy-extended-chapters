## Preparation

### Materials Needed
- Student handout: L-47 Day 1 content (printed or digital)
- Investment Characteristics Comparison Chart (projected)
- Examples of actual stock/bond/fund prices (use recent market data)
- Investment Type Analyzer (skill builder tool - ensure student access)
- Calculator or spreadsheet for fee calculations
- Whiteboard/markers for class discussions

### Technology Setup
- Ensure all students can access the Investment Type Analyzer
- Test that financial data feeds are current (if using live market data)
- Have backup static examples if internet connectivity is unreliable
- Verify projection system for sharing charts and examples

### Background Knowledge Review
Students should have prior understanding of:
- Basic financial goal setting (from earlier chapters)
- Time value of money and compound interest (L-15: The Power of Compound Interest)
- Risk and return relationship (general concept)
- The difference between saving and investing

### Key Preparation Note
This lesson introduces complex concepts that may intimidate students who associate "investing" with wealth or expertise. Emphasize throughout that investing is accessible to anyone who earns income, requires only basic understanding to start effectively, and is essential for building long-term financial security. Use relatable, middle-income examples exclusively.

## Detailed Lesson Plan

### Introduction & Hook (5 minutes)

**Timing: 0:00-0:05**

**Opening Poll (2 minutes):**
"If someone gave you $1,000 today that you don't need for 30 years, what would you do with it?"

Options:
- A) Keep it in a savings account earning 0.5% interest
- B) Buy stock in a company I like
- C) Invest in a fund that owns many different stocks and bonds
- D) Keep it under my mattress

Take quick poll (hand raise or digital polling). Record results.

**Discussion (3 minutes):**
"Let's see what each choice would become in 30 years..."
- Option A (savings): $1,000 × 1.005^30 = $1,161 (gain of $161)
- Option B (stock): Average 10% annually = $17,449 (gain of $16,449) but highly uncertain
- Option C (fund): Average 8% annually = $10,063 (gain of $9,063)
- Option D (mattress): Still $1,000, but worth less due to inflation (purchasing power about $550)

"Today we're learning about the investment options that can help your money grow substantially over time—and understanding the differences between them so you can make informed choices."

### Learning Objectives (5 minutes)

**Timing: 0:05-0:10**

**Present Objectives (2 minutes):**
Display and read through the five learning objectives. For each, briefly explain what it means in practical terms:
- "Analyze characteristics" = Understand what makes stocks different from bonds
- "Compare risk-return profiles" = Know which investments are riskier but potentially more rewarding
- "Evaluate alignment with goals" = Match investments to your specific financial situation
- "Calculate returns/assess risks" = Use actual numbers to understand potential outcomes
- "Make informed decisions" = Feel confident taking first steps in investing

**Connect to Prior Learning (3 minutes):**
"We've already learned about several concepts that directly connect to investing..."
- Compound interest (L-15): This is HOW investments grow exponentially over time
- Financial goal setting (L-4): Investments are TOOLS for achieving medium and long-term goals
- Risk management (if covered): Different investments carry different risks; understanding this helps us choose wisely

"Today builds on those foundations by introducing the specific investment vehicles available to you."

### Key Concepts (10 minutes)

**Timing: 0:10-0:20**

**Teaching Strategy:**
Present each concept with definition, visual representation, and brief example. Use the Investment Characteristics Comparison Chart projected so students can see differences side-by-side.

**Stocks (2 minutes):**
- Definition: "Ownership shares in a company"
- Example: "If you buy Apple stock, you own a tiny piece of Apple. When Apple succeeds, your share value increases."
- Key characteristic: Higher potential returns but more volatility
- Visual: Show actual Apple stock chart over 5 years, noting ups and downs

**Bonds (2 minutes):**
- Definition: "Loans you make to governments or companies that pay you interest"
- Example: "A 10-year Treasury bond pays you 4% annually for 10 years, then returns your principal."
- Key characteristic: More stable than stocks, lower returns
- Visual: Show how a $10,000 bond pays steady $400 annually

**Mutual Funds (3 minutes):**
- Definition: "Professionally managed pools of money investing in many securities"
- Example: "Fidelity 500 Fund owns stock in 500 large companies. When you invest, you own a piece of all 500."
- Key characteristic: Instant diversification, professional management, higher fees
- Visual: Diagram showing how many investors' money is pooled
- Important point: Explain expense ratios with concrete example (1% fee on $10,000 = $100/year)

**ETFs (3 minutes):**
- Definition: "Like mutual funds but trade on exchanges like stocks"
- Example: "VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF) also tracks 500 companies but charges only 0.03% vs. typical 1% for mutual funds."
- Key characteristic: Low fees, tax efficient, trade any time markets are open
- Visual: Side-by-side comparison of mutual fund vs. ETF costs over 30 years

**Supporting Concepts (quick definitions):**
- Dividends, capital gains, interest, risk tolerance, diversification, liquidity (1-sentence each)

### Deeper Exploration (15 minutes)

**Timing: 0:20-0:35**

This section requires careful pacing. Prioritize depth of understanding over covering every detail. Use examples liberally.

**Understanding Stocks (4 minutes):**

*Facilitation Approach:*
"Let's really understand how stocks work with a concrete example."

Use a company students know (e.g., Nike, Microsoft, Target):
- Show current stock price (e.g., $175)
- Explain what that means: "You can become a part-owner of Microsoft for $175 per share."
- Discuss what makes stock prices rise/fall: company performance, economic conditions, investor sentiment
- Highlight historical returns: "S&P 500 averaged 10% annually over past 95 years" but stress volatility
- Show worst year (2008: -37%) and best year (1954: +45%) to illustrate risk

*Key teaching point:* "Stocks are for LONG-TERM goals. Short-term, they're too unpredictable. But over decades, they've outperformed all other major investment types."

*Check for understanding:* "If you invested $100 in a stock and it went up 10%, what is it worth?" ($110)

**Understanding Bonds (3 minutes):**

*Facilitation Approach:*
"Bonds work completely differently. You're the lender, not the owner."

Walk through bond mechanics:
- "You buy a $10,000 bond paying 4% for 10 years"
- "Every year, you receive $400 (4% of $10,000)"
- "After 10 years, you get your $10,000 back"
- Total received: $4,000 in interest + $10,000 principal = $14,000

Explain bond risks:
- Default risk: "What if the borrower can't repay?" (Bond ratings address this)
- Interest rate risk: "If rates rise to 6%, your 4% bond is less valuable if you want to sell early"

*Key teaching point:* "Bonds provide STABILITY and INCOME. They protect your portfolio when stocks are falling."

**Understanding Mutual Funds (4 minutes):**

*Facilitation Approach:*
"Mutual funds solve a major problem: How can regular people diversify without millions of dollars?"

Explain the pooling concept:
- 10,000 investors each contribute $5,000 = $50 million pool
- Professional manager uses $50 million to buy hundreds of different stocks/bonds
- Each investor owns a proportional share of everything

Highlight the fee issue with concrete math:
- Portfolio: $10,000
- Annual return: 8%
- Low-cost fund (0.05% fee): After 30 years = $99,580
- Average fund (1% fee): After 30 years = $74,093
- Difference: $25,487 lost to fees!

*Key teaching point:* "Fees seem tiny but compound over time. A 1% fee difference can cost you 25% of your wealth over 30 years."

*Activity:* Have students calculate: "If you invest $500/month for 30 years at 8% return, what's the difference between 0.05% and 1.25% fees?" (Approximately $80,000 difference!)

**Understanding ETFs (4 minutes):**

*Facilitation Approach:*
"ETFs combine the best features of mutual funds and stocks."

Create comparison table on board:

|  | Mutual Fund | ETF |
|---|---|---|
| Diversification | ✓ Yes | ✓ Yes |
| Professional Management | ✓ Often | △ Passive tracking |
| When can you trade? | End of day only | Any time market is open |
| Typical fees | 0.50% - 1.50% | 0.03% - 0.25% |
| Minimum investment | Often $1,000-$3,000 | Price of 1 share (~$50-$400) |

*Key teaching point:* "For most beginning investors, low-cost index ETFs offer the simplest, most effective way to build wealth. You get instant diversification across hundreds or thousands of companies for minimal fees."

**Example:** "With just $300, you could buy one share of VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF) and own a piece of 500 of America's largest companies, paying only 0.03% in annual fees."

### Real-World Examples (8 minutes)

**Timing: 0:35-0:43**

**Teaching Strategy:**
These examples show different valid approaches to investing. Present each, then facilitate brief discussion about why each strategy did or didn't work well.

**Example 1: Priya's Index Fund Approach (2.5 minutes)**

Read the example from student content. Emphasize:
- Started with just $563/month (15% of a $45,000 salary)
- Used simple two-fund portfolio (stock ETF + bond ETF)
- Automated contributions ("set it and forget it")
- Didn't panic during 15% loss year
- Built $52,000 in 6 years despite volatility

*Discussion:* "What made Priya's approach successful?"
- Simplicity, consistency, low fees, emotional discipline

**Example 2: Marcus's Individual Stock Lessons (2.5 minutes)**

Read the example. Highlight:
- Tried to beat the market by picking winning stocks
- Got too emotionally involved (checking prices daily)
- Sold biotech stock at loss (panic selling)
- Held declining retail stock hoping for recovery (loss aversion)
- Underperformed index fund by 8 percentage points

*Discussion:* "What mistakes did Marcus make?"
- Emotional decisions, trying to time markets, not diversified enough
"How did he recover?" - Shifted to index funds for core portfolio, kept small amount for individual stocks to satisfy interest

*Teaching point:* "Even professional fund managers rarely beat index funds consistently. As beginners, simple strategies usually work better than complex ones."

**Example 3: Aisha's Diversified Bond Strategy (3 minutes)**

Read the example. Emphasize:
- Age 55, approaching retirement, shifted from 85% stocks to 60% stocks
- Added bonds for stability as time horizon shortened
- When market dropped 18%, her portfolio only dropped 9%
- Bonds provided $8,400 annual income
- Strategy matched her life stage

*Discussion:* "Why did Aisha add bonds?"
- Closer to needing the money, can't afford large losses, wanted income

*Teaching point:* "Your investment strategy should evolve as your life situation changes. What works at 25 is different from what works at 55."

**Wrap-up Examples Discussion (1 minute):**
"Notice all three examples showed discipline and long-term thinking. None tried to get rich quick. That's the real secret to investment success—time and consistency, not brilliance."

### Reflection & Discussion (5 minutes)

**Timing: 0:43-0:48**

**Reflection Prompt (presented on board):**
"Think about your current financial situation and goals. If you have $200 per month to invest over the next 10 years, how would you allocate it among stocks, bonds, and cash? What factors influence your decision?"

**Individual Reflection (2 minutes):**
Students write their thoughts. Encourage them to consider:
- Age and time horizon
- Current financial stability (emergency fund? debts?)
- Goals (retirement? house? business?)
- Comfort with seeing investment values go up and down

**Pair-Share (2 minutes):**
Students discuss with a partner their allocation choices and reasoning.

**Whole-Class Discussion (2 minutes):**
Ask 3-4 students to share their allocations and reasoning. Listen for:
- Understanding that longer time horizon → more stocks appropriate
- Recognition that emergency funds should come before investing
- Awareness of personal risk tolerance
- Connection between goals and investment choices

*Affirm diverse approaches:* "There's no single 'right' answer. The right allocation depends on YOUR specific situation, goals, and risk tolerance. What matters is making an informed, intentional choice."

### Skill Builder Introduction (5 minutes)

**Timing: 0:48-0:53**

**Introduce the Investment Type Analyzer:**
"Now you'll use an interactive tool to explore these concepts hands-on."

**Tool Overview (2 minutes):**
Demonstrate the key features:
- Compare different investment scenarios (conservative, moderate, growth, custom)
- See historical risk/return data
- Input monthly investment amounts
- View projected growth over time
- Compare fees' impact
- Build custom portfolios

**Instructions (2 minutes):**
Walk through Activity steps:
1. Review four scenarios (conservative through custom)
2. Input a monthly amount ($50-$500)
3. See growth projections for 10, 20, 30 years
4. Select specific investments for custom portfolio
5. Answer reflection questions about risk tolerance and goals

**Time Expectation (1 minute):**
"You have until end of class to start exploring the tool. We'll use it extensively in tomorrow's Learning Lab, so familiarize yourself with the interface. Focus especially on understanding how different allocations affect both potential returns and risk levels."

### Wrap-up & Preview (2 minutes)

**Timing: 0:53-0:55**

**Key Takeaways Summary:**
"Today we learned about four major investment types:"
- Stocks: Ownership, higher returns, higher risk, long-term focus
- Bonds: Lending, steady income, lower risk, stability
- Mutual Funds: Diversification, professional management, watch the fees
- ETFs: Diversification + low fees, great for beginners

"The right mix depends on your goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. There's no need to be an expert—simple, low-cost, diversified portfolios work excellently for building wealth."

**Preview Day 2:**
"Tomorrow's Learning Lab is all hands-on application. You'll:
- Analyze real investment data and performance
- Compare stocks vs. bonds in different economic scenarios
- Calculate the impact of fees over decades
- Build portfolios for different life situations
- Develop your personal investment decision framework

Come ready to work with numbers, make decisions, and think critically about how these concepts apply to your own financial future."

**Homework (if assigning):**
"Before next class, think about one long-term financial goal you have and how investments might help you achieve it. Also, research one low-cost brokerage (Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab) and see what their investment options look like."

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Advanced Students
- **Extension Activity:** Research and present on alternative investments (REITs, commodities, cryptocurrency) comparing their risk-return profiles to traditional stocks and bonds
- **Deeper Analysis:** Calculate the exact future value of various portfolios using compound interest formulas rather than rules of thumb
- **Case Study:** Analyze a real investor's portfolio (e.g., Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holdings) and evaluate the strategy
- **Challenge Problem:** "If someone has $50,000 to invest, design three different portfolios (aggressive, moderate, conservative) with specific funds/ETFs and justify each choice"

### For Struggling Students
- **Simplified Vocabulary:** Create a reference sheet with just the 5-6 most essential terms (stock, bond, mutual fund, ETF, diversification, fee)
- **Visual Aids:** Provide graphic organizers comparing investment types side-by-side with simple icons
- **Concrete Examples:** Use even simpler numbers and scenarios: "$100 investment in stock vs. bond, what happens after 1 year?"
- **Scaffolded Skill Builder:** Provide step-by-step screenshot guide for using the Investment Type Analyzer
- **Partner Support:** Pair with stronger students for Skill Builder activity with clear roles (navigator and recorder)

### For English Language Learners (ELL)
- **Bilingual Glossary:** Provide key terms in student's native language
- **Visual Representations:** Use charts, graphs, and diagrams extensively to show concepts not just describe them
- **Sentence Frames:** Provide structures like "I would invest ___% in stocks because..." or "Bonds are less risky than stocks because..."
- **Preview Vocabulary:** Share key terms day before the lesson with simple definitions
- **Extended Time:** Allow extra time for Skill Builder exploration and reflection writing

### For Diverse Learning Needs
- **Kinesthetic Learners:** Use physical manipulatives (poker chips representing money) to simulate building portfolios
- **Auditory Learners:** Provide podcast/audio summary of key concepts for review
- **Reading Support:** Offer audio version of student content text
- **Executive Function Support:** Provide clear checklist of Skill Builder steps with checkboxes
- **Reduced Anxiety:** Emphasize repeatedly that investing is learned through practice, mistakes are okay, and even small investments matter

## Common Misconceptions and Challenges

### Misconception 1: "Investing is only for wealthy people"
**Why students think this:** Media shows wealthy investors; minimum investment amounts seem high
**Reality:** Many brokerages have no minimums; ETFs can be purchased for under $100; apps enable fractional share investing
**How to address:** Show examples of people starting with $50-100/month; explain how compound interest makes small amounts grow substantially

### Misconception 2: "Stocks are gambling"
**Why students think this:** Both involve risk and uncertainty; media focuses on speculation
**Reality:** Long-term stock investing in diversified portfolios has historically provided positive returns; gambling has negative expected value
**How to address:** Show 30-year historical data; explain that every 20-year period in market history has been positive; discuss difference between speculation and long-term investing

### Misconception 3: "You need to watch the market constantly"
**Why students think this:** Day traders and financial news create impression that investing requires constant attention
**Reality:** Best strategy for most people is passive, long-term investing with infrequent rebalancing
**How to address:** Emphasize Marcus's example of over-monitoring causing poor decisions; explain "set it and forget it" approach

### Misconception 4: "High fees are worth it for professional expertise"
**Why students think this:** Assumes "you get what you pay for" applies to investing
**Reality:** High-fee actively managed funds rarely beat low-fee index funds long-term
**How to address:** Show the fee calculation demonstrating tens of thousands lost to fees; cite research on active management underperformance

### Misconception 5: "Bonds are completely safe"
**Why students think this:** Term "fixed income" sounds guaranteed; bonds are called less risky
**Reality:** Bonds carry default risk and interest rate risk; some bonds (high-yield) are quite risky
**How to address:** Explain bond ratings; discuss 2008 crisis when some bonds defaulted; clarify "lower risk than stocks" ≠ "no risk"

## Assessment Opportunities

### Formative Assessment (During Lesson)

**Quick Checks:**
- After stocks section: "Give me a thumbs up if you understand that stockholders own part of the company, thumb sideways if unsure, thumb down if confused"
- After bonds section: "Who is borrowing money in a bond? Who is lending?" (cold call 2-3 students)
- After fee discussion: "If Fund A charges 0.1% and Fund B charges 1.1%, how much more does Fund B cost on a $10,000 investment per year?" ($100)

**Think-Pair-Share Assessment:**
- "What's the main advantage of ETFs over mutual funds?" Listen for: lower fees, tax efficiency, trading flexibility
- "Why might someone choose bonds over stocks?" Listen for: lower risk, stable income, shorter time horizon

**Skill Builder Observation:**
As students work with Investment Type Analyzer, circulate and:
- Check that students can navigate the tool
- Ask individuals to explain why they chose certain allocations
- Identify students struggling with interface or concepts for targeted support

### Summative Assessment (End of Lesson/Unit)

**Exit Ticket (if using):**
"Name one investment type and explain when it would be appropriate to use it based on a specific goal or situation."

Scoring:
- 3 points: Names investment, provides appropriate scenario, explains reasoning with reference to risk/return/time horizon
- 2 points: Names investment and provides appropriate scenario with basic reasoning
- 1 point: Names investment but scenario doesn't align with characteristics
- 0 points: Incomplete or shows misunderstanding

**Skill Builder Reflection Questions:**
Review student responses to reflection questions for:
- Understanding of risk-return relationship
- Ability to match investments to goals and time horizons
- Recognition of fee impact
- Realistic self-assessment of risk tolerance

**Day 2 Portfolio Project:**
Tomorrow's Goal-Based Portfolio Builder serves as performance assessment showing student ability to apply all concepts in realistic scenarios

## State-Specific Customization Checklist

**Note:** L-47 is primarily investment-agnostic content. The core concepts of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs are universal. However, minor customizations may enhance relevance:

### Optional State Customization Areas

**1. Local Company Examples:**
- [ ] Identify 2-3 publicly traded companies headquartered in or prominently associated with your state
- [ ] Use these as stock examples (e.g., Tesla for Texas/California, Boeing for Washington, Boeing for Washington, JP Morgan for New York)

**2. State Retirement Plans:**
- [ ] If state has specific retirement savings programs (e.g., CalSavers, OregonSaves), mention as context
- [ ] Note that these plans typically invest in similar vehicles (stocks, bonds, funds)

**3. Tax Considerations (if relevant):**
- [ ] Some states tax investment income differently than wages
- [ ] Capital gains tax rates vary by state
- [ ] Municipal bond interest may be state tax-free (state-specific bonds)

**4. Local Investor Resources:**
- [ ] Identify state securities regulator website for investor education
- [ ] Note any local investment education workshops or programs (often through state treasurer's office)

**5. Cost of Living Context:**
- [ ] Adjust example investment amounts to reflect state cost of living if significantly different from examples
- [ ] Example: $200/month investment may need to be $250/month in high-cost states or $150 in lower-cost states

**Most Content Is Universal:**
The vast majority of this lesson requires no state customization. Investment types, risk-return relationships, fee impacts, and portfolio strategies are the same in all states. Focus on excellent delivery of universal concepts rather than extensive customization.

**End of Day 1 Teacher Guide**

*Remember: The goal is not to make students investment experts, but to remove intimidation, build foundational understanding, and inspire them to start investing early even with small amounts. Enthusiasm and encouragement matter more than covering every technical detail.*
