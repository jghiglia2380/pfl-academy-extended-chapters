- Use multiple examples to reinforce each concept
- Connect every concept to student financial decisions
- Build from simple (supply and demand) to complex (market structures)

### Day 2 Philosophy
- 90% hands-on activities, 10% instruction/reflection
- Progress from structured (simulator practice) to open-ended (real research)
- Culminate in personal application (actual planned purchase)
- Emphasize actionable strategies, not just understanding

### Teacher Role
- Day 1: Instructor and facilitator (direct teaching with engagement)
- Day 2: Coach and monitor (circulate, prompt, assist)
- Throughout: Connect theory to real financial impact

## Integration with Other Chapters
