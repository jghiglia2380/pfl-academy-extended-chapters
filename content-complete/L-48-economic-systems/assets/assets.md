### 4. Property Rights Case Study Library

**Purpose:** Real-world examples of how property rights affect economic outcomes

**Cases Included:**
- Zimbabwe land seizures (2000-2010): Destroyed agriculture, caused hyperinflation

## Development Priority
1. Economic Systems Comparison Tool (comprehensive primary tool)
2. Mixed Economy Design Tool (engages students in system creation)
3. Freedom vs. Security Analyzer (personal relevance)
4. Property Rights Case Studies (concrete examples)
5. Historical Outcomes Database (evidence base)

---

**Design Philosophy:** Tools should help students understand economic systems objectively using data and evidence, not political ideology. Every interactive element should connect to personal financial implications—career opportunities, wealth-building potential, entrepreneurship access.
