## State-Specific Content Strategy

**Classification:** Tier 3 (Fully Agnostic)

**Rationale:**
- Contract law principles are universal across all states
- Five essential elements apply everywhere
- Contract literacy skills (reading carefully, identifying red flags, calculating costs, negotiating) work for contracts anywhere
- Minor state variations (age of majority, non-compete enforceability, landlord-tenant laws) are acknowledged conceptually without requiring state-specific data

**Variables Used:** Minimal (documented in VARIABLES.md)
- Primarily uses `{{STATE_NAME}}` when referencing "your state's laws"
- Content acknowledges that "laws vary by state" in specific areas
- Students are directed to research their state's specifics when facing real contracts

**Efficiency:** One universal template serves all 50 states without modification

## Alignment to Louisiana Requirements

**Louisiana PFL Requirement Addressed:** Topic (j) - Simple Contracts

**How L-60 Fulfills This:**
- Comprehensive coverage of contract elements, terminology, and principles
- Focus on financial contracts relevant to students (leases, loans, service agreements)
- Practical application through analysis of real contracts
- Skill development in reading, interpreting, and evaluating contracts
- Tools and checklists for ongoing contract literacy

**Louisiana-Specific Notes:**
- Louisiana age of majority: 18 (consistent with most states)
- Louisiana has specific consumer protection laws; students directed to research state resources
- Chapter is general enough to work perfectly for Louisiana while being usable by any state

## Real-World Examples Summary

**Example 1: Aaliyah's Apartment Lease Trap**
- 21-year-old who didn't read 15-page lease
- Needed to break lease for job opportunity after 3 months
- Discovered: 60-day notice, no subletting without $500 application fee, 2 months' rent termination penalty
- Cost: $3,800 in penalties and lost security deposit
- **Lesson:** Reading contracts before signing can prevent expensive surprises

**Example 2: Marcus's Cell Phone Contract Mistake**
- Signed "free phone" contract without reading
- Discovered phone was financed over 24 months (not free)
- Early cancellation: $350 fee + $800 remaining phone balance = $1,150
- Would have saved $1,400 over 2 years with used phone and no-contract plan
- **Lesson:** "Free" offers often hide long-term costs in contracts

**Example 3: Sofia's Informed Contract Negotiation**
- Read entire 5-page job offer carefully
- Identified problematic non-compete clause (2 years, 50-mile radius)
- Researched whether terms were standard
- Negotiated professionally to reduce to 1 year, 25 miles
- Also negotiated health benefits from 90 to 60 days
- **Lesson:** Understanding contracts allows successful negotiation; employer respected her professionalism

## Usage Notes for Curriculum Coordinators

**When to teach L-60:**
- As part of Louisiana curriculum (required topic)
- Before students sign their first apartment lease
- When students are entering workforce (employment contracts)
- As foundation before L-61 (Advanced Contract Evaluation)
- Whenever contract literacy is identified as a student need

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic reading comprehension
- Understanding of financial concepts (loans, interest, fees)
- Familiarity with common financial products students encounter

**Follow-up chapters:**
- L-61: Contract Evaluation and Consumer Protection (advanced application)
- L-57: Loan Application Process (applies contract literacy to loan agreements)
- L-30: Renting vs. Owning (applies contract literacy to housing decisions)

## Final Notes

L-60 fills a critical gap in financial literacy education. Most personal finance curricula cover budgeting, saving, and investing, but few teach the practical skill of reading and understanding the contracts that govern so many financial relationships. This chapter empowers students with immediately applicable skills that will save them thousands of dollars and prevent legal problems throughout their lives.

The chapter's strength is its practical, empowering approach: contracts aren't scary legal documents to avoid—they're agreements you can understand, evaluate, and negotiate when you have the right skills.

**L-60 is complete and ready for implementation.**
