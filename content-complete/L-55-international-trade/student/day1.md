## Opening Discussion

**Look at what you're wearing right now. Check the tags.**

Where were your clothes made?
- Shirt: Made in _______
- Pants: Made in _______
- Shoes: Made in _______
- Phone: Made in _______

**Most likely:** China, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Mexico, Indonesia

**Why?** Because international trade allows you to buy quality products at lower prices.

**Your iPhone Example:**
- Designed: California
- Parts from: 43 countries (South Korea, Japan, Germany, Taiwan, etc.)
- Assembled: China
- Software: USA
- Sold: Worldwide

**This is GLOBALIZATION** - your everyday life depends on international trade.

## Why Countries Trade: Comparative Advantage

### The Fundamental Question

**Why doesn't the US make everything itself?** We have technology, resources, workers. Why trade?

**Answer:** **Comparative advantage** - Countries benefit by specializing in what they do relatively best.

### Simple Example: You and Your Roommate

**You:**
- Can clean apartment in 1 hour
- Can cook dinner in 2 hours

**Roommate:**
- Can clean apartment in 3 hours
- Can cook dinner in 4 hours

**You're better at BOTH tasks** (absolute advantage). Should you do everything?

**NO!** Here's why:

**Your opportunity cost:**
- Cleaning = Give up 0.5 dinners (1 hour vs. 2 hours)
- Cooking = Give up 2 cleanings (2 hours vs. 1 hour)

**Roommate's opportunity cost:**
- Cleaning = Give up 0.75 dinners (3 hours vs. 4 hours)
- Cooking = Give up 1.33 cleanings (4 hours vs. 3 hours)

**Optimal arrangement:**
- **You cook** (lower opportunity cost: 2 cleanings vs. roommate's 1.33)
- **Roommate cleans** (lower opportunity cost: 0.75 dinners vs. your 0.5)

**Result:** Both tasks done in less total time through specialization!

### Country Example: USA and China

**USA:**
- High-tech manufacturing (airplanes, software, medical devices)
- Financial services
- Higher education
- Agriculture (large-scale, mechanized)

**China:**
- Labor-intensive manufacturing (textiles, electronics assembly)
- Lower labor costs
- Massive production scale

**Even though USA could produce clothing, it's more efficient to:**
- USA produces high-tech goods
- China produces clothing
- Trade with each other
- Both countries get more total goods

**This is why trade makes both countries richer.**

## Benefits of International Trade

### For Consumers (YOU)

**1. Lower Prices**
- iPhone made in USA would cost $2,000+ (vs. ~$800)
- T-shirt made in USA: $50 (vs. $10 imported)
- Savings = more purchasing power

**2. More Variety**
- Bananas year-round (from Central America)
- Electronics from Asia
- Cars from Germany, Japan, Korea
- Wines from France, Italy, Chile

**3. Higher Quality**
- Global competition forces improvement
- Best products from anywhere
- Innovation spreads faster

**Example:** Your annual savings from trade estimated at $10,000-15,000/year (lower prices across all goods)

### For {{STATE_NAME}} Businesses

## Costs of International Trade

### Job Displacement

**The Hard Truth:** Trade creates winners and losers.

**Example: Manufacturing Jobs**
- 1990: 17.7 million US manufacturing jobs
- 2024: 12.8 million manufacturing jobs
- Lost: ~5 million jobs (many to trade with China, Mexico, automation)

**Who's hurt:**
- Factory workers whose jobs moved overseas
- Communities dependent on manufacturing
- Older workers hard to retrain

**Example in {{STATE_NAME}}:**
- [Textile factories closed when production moved to Asia]
- [Auto parts manufacturing moved to Mexico]
- **Structural unemployment** (L-54 concept)

**This is REAL pain for real people.**

### Income Inequality

**College-educated workers:** Benefit from trade (higher-paying jobs in export sectors)
**Less-educated workers:** Hurt by trade (manufacturing jobs lost)

**Result:** Trade increases inequality within countries (even as it reduces global inequality)

### National Security Concerns

**Dependence on other countries for:**
- Critical supplies (semiconductors from Taiwan)
- Rare earth minerals (China)
- Pharmaceuticals (India, China)

**Risk:** If trade disrupted (war, pandemic), shortages occur

**COVID-19 Example:**
- Personal protective equipment (PPE) from China
- Supply chain disruptions
- Shortages and price spikes

## Trade Policies: Tariffs and Quotas

Governments can restrict or promote trade:

### Tariffs (Taxes on Imports)

**Tariff** = Tax on imported goods

**Example:** 25% tariff on imported cars
- Foreign car costs $30,000 to import
- + 25% tariff = $7,500 tax
- **Final price:** $37,500

**Effects:**

**1. Protects Domestic Producers**
- Foreign cars more expensive
- Domestic cars more competitive
- Domestic auto workers keep jobs

**2. Hurts Consumers**
- Pay higher prices ($37,500 vs. $30,000)
- Less purchasing power
- Fewer choices

**3. Government Revenue**
- Tariff generates $7,500 × # of cars imported
- Can fund government programs

**4. Retaliation Risk**
- Other countries impose tariffs on US exports
- Hurts US exporters
- Trade war

**Recent Example: Trump Tariffs (2018-2019)**
- 25% tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods
- Goal: Protect US manufacturing, reduce trade deficit
- China retaliated with tariffs on US agriculture
- Result: Higher prices for consumers, hurt some farmers, mixed effects on manufacturing

### Quotas (Quantity Limits)

**Quota** = Limit on quantity of imports

**Example:** Only 10,000 foreign cars allowed per year

**Effects:**
- Reduces supply
- Prices rise (scarcity)
- Protects domestic producers
- Hurts consumers
- No government revenue (unlike tariff)

### Free Trade Agreements

**Examples:**
- **USMCA** (US-Mexico-Canada Agreement): Replaced NAFTA
- **European Union:** 27 countries, no tariffs between them

**Benefits:**
- Lower/zero tariffs
- Increased trade
- Economic growth

**Costs:**
- Some job displacement
- Loss of policy independence

## Exchange Rates

**Exchange Rate** = Price of one currency in terms of another

**Example:**
- $1 USD = 150 Japanese Yen
- $1 USD = 0.92 Euro
- $1 USD = 7.3 Chinese Yuan

### How Exchange Rates Affect You

**1. Travel**

**Scenario:** You're visiting Europe (exchange rate: $1 = €0.92)

**Hotel costs €100/night**
- In dollars: €100 / 0.92 = $108.70

**If dollar strengthens to $1 = €1.00:**
- Same hotel: €100 = $100
- **You save $8.70/night!**

**Strong dollar = Cheaper to travel abroad**
**Weak dollar = More expensive to travel abroad**

**2. Imported Goods**

**Scenario:** You buy Japanese car for ¥3,000,000

**Exchange rate: $1 = ¥150**
- Price in dollars: ¥3,000,000 / 150 = $20,000

**If dollar weakens to $1 = ¥120:**
- Same car: ¥3,000,000 / 120 = $25,000
- **$5,000 more expensive!**

**Strong dollar = Cheaper imports**
**Weak dollar = More expensive imports**

**3. {{STATE_NAME}} Exports**

**Scenario:** {{STATE_NAME}} company sells product for $100 to European customer

**Exchange rate: $1 = €0.92**
- European customer pays: $100 × 0.92 = €92

**If dollar strengthens to $1 = €1.00:**
- European customer pays: $100 × 1.00 = €100
- **More expensive for them → fewer sales → hurts {{STATE_NAME}} exporters**

**Strong dollar = Hurts US exporters** (US goods more expensive abroad)
**Weak dollar = Helps US exporters** (US goods cheaper abroad)

### What Determines Exchange Rates?

**1. Interest Rates**
- Higher US interest rates → Foreign investors buy dollars → Dollar strengthens
- Lower US interest rates → Dollar weakens

**2. Inflation**
- Higher US inflation → Dollar loses value → Dollar weakens
- Lower US inflation → Dollar strengthens

**3. Economic Growth**
- Strong US economy → Investors want dollars → Dollar strengthens

**4. Political Stability**
- Uncertainty → Investors flee → Dollar weakens
- Stability → Investors confident → Dollar strengthens

**Fed's monetary policy (L-53) affects exchange rates through interest rates!**

## The Trade Debate: Free Trade vs. Protectionism

### Free Trade Position

**Arguments FOR free trade:**

**1. Lower prices for consumers** (biggest benefit)
**2. More variety and quality**
**3. Economic efficiency** (comparative advantage)
**4. Global economic growth**
**5. Peace** (countries that trade don't fight wars)

**Who supports:** Economists (90%+), consumers, exporters, retailers

**Quote:** "Free trade is a win-win. Both countries benefit."

### Protectionism Position

**Arguments FOR tariffs/restrictions:**

**1. Protect jobs** (especially manufacturing)
**2. National security** (don't depend on rivals)
**3. Infant industries** (give new industries time to develop)
**4. Fair trade** (other countries cheat, we should respond)
**5. Environmental/labor standards** (don't race to bottom)

**Who supports:** Manufacturing workers, some industries (steel, autos), unions, some politicians

**Quote:** "We need to protect American jobs and not ship them overseas."

### The Economic Consensus

**Most economists favor free trade** because:
- Total benefits > total costs
- Consumers (everyone) benefit more than workers hurt
- Can compensate losers with trade adjustment assistance

**But acknowledge:**
- Job losses are REAL and PAINFUL
- Benefits diffuse (small savings per person), costs concentrated (entire livelihoods lost)
- Need policies to help displaced workers (retraining, assistance)

**Your position will depend on:**
- Are you consumer (benefit from trade) or worker in tradeable sector (maybe hurt)?
- How do you weight efficiency vs. equality?
- What's your time horizon (short-term pain vs. long-term gain)?
