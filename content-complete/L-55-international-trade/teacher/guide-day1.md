## Key Teaching Points

### Opening (5 min)
- Have students check tags on clothes, phone
- Most made internationally - this is normal
- Sets up: Why? (Comparative advantage)

### Comparative Advantage (10 min)
- Use roommate cleaning/cooking example first (relatable)
- Then country example (USA/China)
- **Critical:** Even if USA better at everything, still benefits from specialization
- Opportunity cost determines comparative advantage (link to L-49)

### Benefits of Trade (10 min)
- **For consumers:** Lower prices ($10k-15k/year savings estimated)
- **For businesses:** Larger markets, cheaper inputs
- **For economy:** GDP growth, efficiency
- Emphasize: Students benefit DAILY from trade

### Costs of Trade (10 min)
- **Job displacement:** 5 million manufacturing jobs lost since 1990
- **This is REAL pain** - don't minimize
- Structural unemployment (L-54 link)
- Inequality (college-educated benefit, less-educated hurt)

### Trade Policies (10 min)
- **Tariff:** Tax on imports → higher prices, protects jobs
- **Example:** Trump tariffs 2018-2019 (recent, relevant)
- **Trade-off:** Jobs protected vs. consumer prices up
- **Retaliation risk:** Trade wars hurt everyone

### Exchange Rates (10 min)
- **Strong dollar:** Cheap to travel, cheap imports, but hurts exporters
- **Weak dollar:** Expensive to travel, expensive imports, but helps exporters
- Link to Fed policy (L-53): Interest rates affect exchange rates

### Discussion (10 min)
- Free trade vs. protectionism
- **Key:** There's no objectively "right" answer - depends on values
- Total benefits > total costs, but losers are concentrated
- Should iPhone be made in USA? (Would cost $2,000)

## Differentiation

**For Struggling Students:**
- Focus on comparative advantage concept and consumer benefits
- Skip complex exchange rate calculations
- Provide simpler tariff examples

**For Advanced Students:**
- Calculate comparative advantage numerically
- Research historical trade agreements (NAFTA, TPP, USMCA)
- Analyze current trade policy debates

---

## Common Challenges

**Challenge 1:** "Why can't we just make everything here?"
- **Answer:** Opportunity cost - resources used inefficiently

**Challenge 2:** "Trade destroyed manufacturing jobs!"
- **Answer:** True, but automation also major factor. And consumers benefit from lower prices. Complex trade-offs.

**Challenge 3:** Exchange rates confusing
- **Solution:** Use travel example (most relatable)

## State-Specific Content

Update annually:
- {{STATE_NAME}} top exports and imports
- Trade-dependent industries
- Jobs affected by trade
- Recent trade policy impacts

---

## Assessment

**Formative:**
- Can students explain comparative advantage?
- Do they understand tariff effects?
- Can they calculate exchange rate impacts?

**Tomorrow Preview:**
Students will analyze {{STATE_NAME}} trade, trace supply chains, and plan careers in global economy
