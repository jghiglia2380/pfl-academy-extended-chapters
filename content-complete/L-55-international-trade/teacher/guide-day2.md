## Facilitation Guide

### Activity 1: {{STATE_NAME}} Global Economy (15 min)

**Part A: Exports (7 min)**
- Provide {{STATE_NAME}} export data
- Students identify top exports, destinations, jobs
- **Key insight:** Export jobs often higher-paying

**Part B: Imports (8 min)**
- Students estimate personal import dependence (40-60% typical)
- Calculate tariff impact on budget (25% tariff = $3,000/year cost)
- **Trade-off:** Lower prices vs. domestic jobs
- **Poll:** Would you pay $3,000/year more to protect jobs?
  - Expect mixed responses - good discussion starter

**Coaching:**
- Help students be realistic about import percentages
- Calculator assistance for tariff impacts
- Connect to their daily purchases

---

### Activity 2: Supply Chain Analysis (15 min)

**Part A: Product Mapping (10 min)**
- Students choose product (phone, shoes, laptop)
- Trace supply chain from raw materials to retail
- **iPhone example:** 43 countries involved
- **Key insight:** Complexity = efficiency but vulnerability

**Part B: Vulnerability (5 min)**
- COVID lesson: Semiconductor shortage affected cars, electronics
- **Discussion:** What if China trade banned?
  - Short-term: Shortages, price spikes
  - Long-term: Production shifts (expensive, time-consuming)

**Common Challenge:** Students struggle to find supply chain info
- **Solution:** Provide examples, allow estimates, focus on concept

---

### Activity 3: Career Planning (8 min)

**Vulnerability Assessment:**
- Students assess globalization/automation risk for intended career
- **High risk:** Routine manufacturing, commodity services
- **Low risk:** Local services (haircut, plumber), advanced expertise

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Non-tradeable skills (communication, creativity)
- Specialize in high-value work
- Embrace global opportunities

**Key Teaching Point:**
Don't scare students, but be realistic. Many jobs will change. Preparation and adaptability matter.

---

### Activity 4: Trade Impact Analyzer (7 min)

**Policy Simulation:**
- Free trade vs. 25% tariff vs. targeted tariffs
- Students recommend policy, justify choice
- **Expected:** Diverse opinions (good - shows complexity)

**Debrief:**
- "How many chose free trade? Broad tariffs? Targeted?"
- "What values drove your choice?"
- Emphasize: No perfect answer - depends on priorities

---

### Closing Synthesis (5 min)

**Students identify:**
- #1 career action
- #1 consumer action
- #1 investment learning goal

**Encourage immediate action:**
- Research career field globalization trends
- Check labels on next purchase
