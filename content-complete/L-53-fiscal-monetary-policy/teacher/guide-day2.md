## Detailed Facilitation Guide

### Opening Reflection (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Connect policy to personal financial decisions

**Facilitation Steps:**

1. **Display prompt:** "Think about the last major purchase you or your family made (car, home, appliance, etc.)"

2. **Set timer for 3 minutes silent writing**

3. **Questions on board:**
   - What role did interest rates play?
   - How would decision change if rates were 2% higher or lower?
   - How confident are you about economic conditions?

4. **DO NOT share publicly** (financial decisions are personal)

5. **Transition:** "Interest rates affect EVERY major financial decision. Today you'll see exactly how much - and why Fed changes them."

**Key Teaching Point:**
"Federal Reserve decisions aren't abstract - they affect whether you can afford a home, car, education. Today we'll calculate the real impact."

---

### Activity 1: Federal Reserve Decision Analysis (20 minutes)

**Objective:** Analyze actual Fed decisions and understand their reasoning

---

#### Part A: Reading the Fed (10 minutes)

**Facilitation:**

1. **Introduction (2 minutes):**
   - "You're given economic data from March 2022"
   - "Your job: Decide what Fed should do with interest rates"
   - "Then we'll see what they actually did"

2. **Display data on board:**
   ```
   March 2022:
   - Unemployment: 3.6% (near full employment)
   - Inflation: 8.5% (highest in 40 years)
   - GDP Growth: 3.7% (solid)
   - Federal Funds Rate: 0.25% (near zero)
   - Context: COVID recession ended, massive stimulus spent,
     supply chains disrupted, Russia-Ukraine war
   ```

3. **Independent Work (5 minutes):**

Students answer:
- What should Fed do with rates?
- What's the primary concern?
- What are risks of each option?
- Who wins/loses?

**Circulate and Monitor:**

**Common Student Responses:**
- Some say: "Keep rates low to protect jobs"
- Most say: "Raise rates to fight inflation"
- Key debate: How fast? How high?

**Coaching Questions:**
- "What's worse: High inflation or higher unemployment?"
- "Can you fight inflation without raising unemployment?"
- "What happens if you wait too long?"

4. **Debrief (3 minutes):**

**Poll class:** "How many said raise rates? Keep unchanged?"

**Reveal what Fed actually did:**
- March 2022: Raised by 0.25%
- Then continued: 11 rate increases to 5.5% by July 2023
- Fastest tightening in 40 years

**Results:**
- Inflation fell from 8.5% to 3.1%
- Unemployment stayed low (3.7%)
- No recession (yet)
- Soft landing (so far)

**Discussion:**
- "Did Fed make right call?" (Yes - inflation down, unemployment still low)
- "What surprised you?" (Expected responses: Speed of increases, economy stayed strong)

**Key Teaching Point:**
"Fed's job is HARD. They must balance inflation and unemployment. 2022-23 was a success: Inflation fell without causing recession. But it was risky - could have gone wrong."

---

#### Part B: Fed Chair for a Day (10 minutes)

**Facilitation:**

1. **Introduction (1 minute):**
   - "Now YOU'RE Fed Chair"
   - "Economy is in RECESSION"
   - "What do you do?"

2. **Display scenario on board:**
   ```
   Recession Scenario:
   - Unemployment: 8.5% (rising rapidly)
   - Inflation: 1.8% (below 2% target)
   - GDP Growth: -2.5% (second quarter contraction)
   - Federal Funds Rate: 2.5%
   - Context: Major bank failed, financial panic,
     spending dropping, investment declining
   ```

3. **Independent Work (6 minutes):**

Students decide:
- How much to change interest rates
- What additional actions to take
- Write press release
- Predict outcomes
- Assess personal impact on different groups

**Circulate and Monitor:**

**Look for:**
- Are students cutting rates aggressively? (Should be)
- Do they consider additional tools? (QE, bank loans, forward guidance)
- Are predictions reasonable?

**Coaching Questions:**
- "How fast should you act?"
- "Can rates go below zero?" (Technically, slightly, but not effective)
- "What if cutting rates doesn't work?"

4. **Brief Share (3 minutes):**

**Ask for volunteers:**
- "Who cut rates to 0%? Show of hands"
- "Who did quantitative easing? Why?"
- "What did you say in your press release?"

**Example strong response:**
"Cut rates by 2% to 0.5%, implement QE, provide emergency bank loans. Statement: 'We will do whatever it takes to support the economy and maintain financial stability. We're committed to supporting employment and will keep rates low until recovery is solid.'"

**Key Teaching Point:**
"In severe recession, Fed acts DECISIVELY. Cut rates fast, use all tools. 2008 and 2020: Fed cut to zero within weeks. This prevents panic and supports recovery."

### Activity 2: Federal Budget Analysis (20 minutes)

**Objective:** Evaluate budget priorities and deficit reduction trade-offs

---

#### Part A: Current Federal Budget (10 minutes)

**Facilitation:**

1. **Introduction (1 minute):**
   - "Federal budget is $6 trillion - where does it go?"
   - "You'll analyze priorities and consider how to reduce deficit"

2. **Display budget breakdown on board:**
   ```
   $6 trillion spending:
   - Social Security: $1.2T (20%)
   - Medicare: $0.9T (15%)
   - Medicaid: $0.5T (8%)
   - Defense: $0.8T (13%)
   - Interest: $0.4T (7%)
   - Other: $2.2T (37%)

   Revenue: $4T
   Deficit: $2T
   ```

3. **Independent Work (6 minutes):**

Students answer analysis questions:
- What surprises you?
- Where does most money go?
- What's discretionary vs. mandatory?
- How would you reduce deficit by $500B?

**Circulate and Monitor:**

**Common Student Observations:**
- "Social Security + Medicare + Defense = more than half the budget"
- "Interest on debt is huge - $400B!"
- "Only ~$1T is truly discretionary"
- "Hard to cut without touching big programs"

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Can you cut $500B from discretionary spending alone?" (No - it's only ~$1T total)
- "What happens if you cut Social Security?" (Political backlash, affects retirees)
- "What happens if you raise taxes on everyone?" (Unpopular, may slow economy)

**Key Insight:**
"This is why deficits persist. Can't cut much without touching Social Security, Medicare, Defense. Can't raise taxes without political cost. Result: Deficits continue."

4. **Debrief (3 minutes):**

**Quick poll:**
- "How many would cut spending?" (Show of hands)
- "How many would raise taxes?"
- "How many would do both?"

**Ask:** "Who chose to cut defense?"
- Point out: Defense is only 13%, and politically difficult

**Ask:** "Who chose to raise taxes on high earners?"
- Point out: This is common answer, but high earners already pay ~40% of income taxes

**Key Teaching Point:**
"There's no easy answer. Every choice has political costs and affects real people. That's why Congress struggles with this every year."

---

#### Part B: Stimulus Spending Trade-offs (10 minutes)

**Facilitation:**

1. **Introduction (1 minute):**
   - "Deep recession in {{STATE_NAME}}"
   - "You have $1 trillion to allocate"
   - "Choose your priorities"

2. **Display six options on board:**
   ```
   1. Direct payments ($600B)
   2. Unemployment benefits ($200B)
   3. Infrastructure ($300B)
   4. State/local aid ($250B)
   5. Small business ($400B)
   6. Tax cuts ($500B)
   ```

3. **Independent Work (7 minutes):**

Students allocate $1 trillion across options and justify

**Circulate and Monitor:**

**Look for:**
- Do allocations add to $1T?
- Are justifications thoughtful?
- Do they consider trade-offs?

**Common Patterns:**
- Most spread money across multiple categories
- Heavy weight on direct payments or unemployment (immediate help)
- Some prioritize infrastructure (long-term value)
- Few choose all tax cuts (doesn't help unemployed)

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Who benefits most from direct payments?" (Everyone, but may not spend it)
- "Who benefits from infrastructure?" (Workers in construction, long-term benefit to all)
- "What's the trade-off between speed and long-term value?"

4. **Partner Comparison (2 minutes):**

"Compare your allocation with a partner. How different are they? What values drive your choices?"

**Expected differences:**
- Some prioritize speed (direct payments, unemployment)
- Some prioritize long-term value (infrastructure)
- Some prioritize business (small business loans)
- Reflects different values (equity vs. efficiency, present vs. future)

**Key Teaching Point:**
"Smart people allocate differently because they have different priorities. No single right answer. This is why stimulus bills are so contentious in Congress."

### Activity 3: Interest Rates and Personal Finances (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Calculate real impact of interest rate changes on major purchases

**Note:** Due to time constraints, this may be brief. Can extend if time allows or assign as homework.

**Facilitation:**

1. **Introduction (1 minute):**
   - "See exactly how much interest rates cost you"
   - "Use the tables in your content or online calculators"

2. **Key Comparisons (students read, teacher highlights):**

**Home Purchase:**
- $270,000 loan
- 7% rate: $1,796/month, $376,560 total interest
- 3% rate: $1,139/month, $140,040 total interest
- **Difference: $236,520 over 30 years**

**Display on board:** "$236,520 - That's the cost of Fed's anti-inflation policy"

**Auto Loan:**
- $25,000 loan
- 6.5% rate: $489/month, $4,340 interest
- 2.5% rate: $443/month, $1,580 interest
- **Difference: $2,760**

**Savings:**
- $10,000 saved
- 4.5% rate: $450/year interest, $12,462 after 5 years
- 0.5% rate: $50/year interest, $10,253 after 5 years
- **Difference: $2,209**

3. **Key Questions (2 minutes):**

**Ask class:**
- "Who is hurt by high interest rates?" (Borrowers)
- "Who benefits?" (Savers)
- "Who are you likely to be?" (Borrower - most young people)

**But:**
- "Why are rates high?" (Fight inflation)
- "Would you prefer high rates with low inflation, or low rates with high inflation?"
- Expected: Mixed responses, good debate

4. **Personal Balance Sheet Analysis (2 minutes):**

**Ask:** "Are you NET BORROWER or NET SAVER?"
- Most students: Net borrower (need loans for home, car, education)
- Therefore: Hurt by high rates
- BUT: Benefit from low inflation (salary worth more)

**Key Teaching Point:**
"High interest rates make it harder to buy home, finance education, start business. This is real cost of Fed's inflation fight. But if inflation stayed at 8%, your salary wouldn't keep up. You'd be worse off. Trade-off!"

**If Time Allows:**
Let students use online mortgage calculator to experiment with different rates and amounts

### Activity 4: Policy Impact Simulator (Integrated into Activities 1-2)

**Note:** This skill builder is integrated throughout the Learning Lab rather than a separate activity.

---

### Closing Activity: Policy Philosophy (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Students reflect on their policy views

**Facilitation:**

1. **Display spectrum on board:**
   ```
   Activist ←—————— Middle Ground ——————→ Hands-off
   (Government actively manages)         (Markets self-correct)
   ```

2. **Individual Reflection (3 minutes):**

Students answer:
1. Should government actively manage economy or minimize intervention?
2. Fed priority: Employment or inflation? (Hawkish vs. Dovish)
3. Fiscal policy: Acceptable to run deficits or require balanced budgets?
4. Biggest insight from today?

**No public sharing** - This is personal reflection

3. **Closing Insight (2 minutes):**

**Ask:** "What's your biggest insight from today?"

**Expected responses:**
- "Interest rates affect me more than I realized"
- "Fed's job is really hard - trade-offs everywhere"
- "Budget deficits are hard to reduce"
- "I understand economic news better now"

**Final Message:**

"You now have frameworks to understand economic policy:"
- When Fed raises rates, you know WHY (fight inflation) and WHO it affects (borrowers hurt, savers helped)
- When Congress debates stimulus, you can evaluate TRADE-OFFS (speed vs. debt, efficiency vs. equity)
- When politicians promise to cut deficits, you know how HARD it is (must touch Social Security, Medicare, Defense, or raise taxes)

"Use this knowledge:"
- **Time major purchases** based on interest rate outlook
- **Understand jobs and wage trends** based on Fed policy
- **Evaluate political promises** critically (do the numbers add up?)
- **Vote informed** on economic policy

"That's what financially literate citizens do."

## Differentiation Strategies

**For Struggling Students:**
- Focus on Activity 1 and Activity 3 (most concrete)
- Provide partially completed budget allocation
- Use simpler interest rate examples (round numbers)
- Allow partner work on analysis questions

**For Advanced Students:**
- Calculate mortgage amortization schedules
- Research specific Fed decisions in depth
- Analyze Phillips Curve implications
- Create detailed budget proposal with full justification

**For ELL Students:**
- Provide sentence frames for analysis
- Allow use of translation tools
- Pair with bilingual peer
- Use visual charts and graphs heavily

**For IEP Students:**
- Provide graphic organizers for Fed decision analysis
- Allow calculator use for all calculations
- Break activities into smaller steps
- Offer oral responses instead of written

---

## Assessment

**Formative (During Class):**
- Quality of Fed decision analysis
- Thoughtfulness of budget allocation
- Ability to calculate interest rate impacts
- Depth of reasoning in trade-off discussions

**Summative:**

**Option 1: Policy Analysis Portfolio**
Students submit:
- Completed Activity 1 (Fed decision analysis)
- Completed Activity 2 (budget analysis with allocation)
- Reflection on policy philosophy

**Grading Rubric:**
- Analyzes Fed decision with clear reasoning (25%)
- Evaluates budget trade-offs comprehensively (25%)
- Understands interest rate personal impact (20%)
- Recognizes multiple perspectives (15%)
- Shows critical thinking and nuance (15%)

**Option 2: Fed Chair Simulation Report**
Students write 2-page report:
- Given economic scenario
- State your policy response (fiscal and monetary)
- Justify with economic reasoning
- Predict outcomes
- Address trade-offs and risks

---

## Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1: Students want Fed to keep rates low always**
- **Solution:** Explain inflation risk. "1970s: Fed kept rates low, inflation hit 14%. That's worse than high rates."

**Challenge 2: Budget deficit solutions are politically charged**
- **Solution:** Refocus on ECONOMICS. "We're not debating politics. We're analyzing trade-offs. What does cutting Social Security do to retirees? What does raising taxes do to growth?"

**Challenge 3: Interest rate calculations seem abstract**
- **Solution:** Use real examples they'll face. "When you buy your first home in 5 years, these rates will matter. Let's see exactly how much."

**Challenge 4: Wide variation in completion pace**
- **Solution:** Have extension questions ready. "Finished early? Calculate how much you'd save over 30 years by paying extra $100/month on mortgage."

**Challenge 5: Some students overwhelmed by numbers**
- **Solution:** Provide calculator support, focus on concepts not perfect calculations. "Ballpark is fine - we're learning patterns, not exact answers."

## Materials Needed

- Student learning lab content (day2.md)
- Fed decision case study with economic data
- Current federal budget breakdown
- Calculators or online tools
- Whiteboard for collecting insights
- Timer
- Policy philosophy spectrum visual

## Connection to Day 1

Reference yesterday's concepts:

- **Fiscal policy:** "Remember government spending and taxation? Now you're allocating actual budget."
- **Monetary policy:** "Remember federal funds rate? Now you're setting it as Fed Chair."
- **Trade-offs:** "Every policy has costs and benefits - now you're weighing them."
- **Affects you:** "Yesterday we learned theory. Today you calculated real impact on YOUR finances."

---

## Connection to L-54 (Preview)

**Closing Preview (30 seconds):**

"Tomorrow: L-54 - Inflation, Unemployment, and Personal Finance"

"Now that you understand how policy affects economy, we'll explore:"
- **What is inflation?** How measured? Why matters?
- **What causes unemployment?** Different types, natural rate
- **Phillips Curve** - Can you reduce both inflation and unemployment simultaneously?
- **How to protect yourself** - Strategies for different economic conditions

"Question to think about: If unemployment is 4% and inflation is 3%, should Fed raise or lower rates?"

---

## Key Takeaways to Emphasize

At end of class, ensure students understand:

✓ **Fed decision analysis** - Understand reasoning behind interest rate changes

✓ **Budget trade-offs** - Hard to reduce deficits without touching major programs or raising taxes

✓ **Interest rate personal impact** - Huge difference in total cost (hundreds of thousands over 30 years)

✓ **Net borrower vs. net saver** - Most young people are borrowers, hurt by high rates but helped by low inflation

✓ **Policy philosophy** - Different values lead to different policy preferences, no single right answer

✓ **Real-world application** - Can now understand economic news, Fed decisions, budget debates

✓ **Financial planning** - Time major purchases based on economic conditions and rate outlook

---

## Notes for Next Year

- Update Fed decision case study (use most recent dramatic decision)
- Update federal budget numbers (change annually)
- Update interest rates in examples (current rates)
- Activity 3 needs more time if doing calculations - consider 10 minutes
- Consider creating interactive Excel tool for interest rate comparisons
- Students very engaged by "Fed Chair for a Day" - keep this
- Budget allocation activity generates good discussion - allow time for partner comparison
- Some students want to debate politics - keep refocusing on economic trade-offs
- Interest rate examples hit home - these are REAL costs they'll face

---

## Success Indicators

Students successfully completed today if they can:
- Analyze Fed decisions using economic reasoning
- Identify budget trade-offs and allocation challenges
- Calculate interest rate impacts on major purchases
- Recognize they are likely net borrowers (hurt by high rates, helped by low inflation)
- Articulate their own policy philosophy with reasoning
- Apply concepts to real economic news and decisions

**Most Important:** Students leave understanding how macroeconomic policy DIRECTLY affects their financial decisions and life opportunities.
