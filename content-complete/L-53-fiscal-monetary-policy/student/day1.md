## Day 1: How Government Stabilizes the Economy

### Learning Objectives
By the end of today's lesson, you will be able to:
- Explain fiscal policy tools: government spending, taxation, and budget deficits/surpluses
- Explain monetary policy tools: Federal Reserve, interest rates, and money supply
- Analyze how fiscal and monetary policy affect employment, inflation, and economic growth
- Evaluate policy responses to recessions and inflation

## Opening: 2008 Financial Crisis - When the Economy Nearly Collapsed

**March 2008:** Bear Stearns, major investment bank, collapses
**September 2008:** Lehman Brothers fails, stock market crashes 40%
**Unemployment:** Rises from 5% to 10%
**Home values:** Drop 30%
**Credit:** Freezes - businesses can't get loans

**What did government do?**

**Federal Reserve (Monetary Policy):**
- Cut interest rates to nearly 0%
- Bought $4 trillion in bonds (quantitative easing)
- Provided emergency loans to banks

**Congress & President (Fiscal Policy):**
- $700 billion bank bailout
- $800 billion stimulus package (spending + tax cuts)
- Extended unemployment benefits

**Result:**
- Recession ended in 2009
- Slow recovery over next 7 years
- Prevented Great Depression 2.0?

**Debate:**
- Did government intervention save the economy?
- Was it too much or too little?
- Should government have this much power?

**Today's Goal:** Understand HOW government tries to stabilize the economy and WHETHER it works.

## Connecting to What You've Learned

**From L-48 (Economic Systems):**
- {{STATE_NAME}}'s mixed economy includes government stabilization role
- Pure markets can have boom-bust cycles
- Government attempts to smooth these cycles

**From L-49 (Opportunity Cost):**
- Every government spending decision has opportunity cost
- Deficit spending today = debt repayment tomorrow
- Trade-offs between current and future generations

**From L-50 (Supply & Demand):**
- Government policies shift aggregate supply and demand
- Changes affect prices (inflation) and output (employment)

**From L-51 (Market Structures):**
- Banking system is oligopoly with special government oversight
- Federal Reserve regulates money supply

**From L-52 (Government's Economic Role):**
- Market failures justify intervention
- Government's role includes economic stabilization
- L-52 focused on microeconomic intervention (specific markets)
- L-53 focuses on macroeconomic stabilization (entire economy)

**Today's Framework:**
Government uses TWO tools to stabilize economy:
1. **Fiscal Policy** = Government spending and taxation
2. **Monetary Policy** = Federal Reserve managing interest rates and money supply

---

## The Business Cycle: Why We Need Stabilization Policy

### The Business Cycle

Economies naturally go through cycles:

```
        Boom/Expansion
           /\
          /  \
         /    \
Trough  /      \ Peak
-------         -------
        \      /
         \    /
          \  /
           \/
        Recession/Contraction
```

**Four Phases:**

**1. Expansion:**
- GDP growing
- Unemployment falling
- Incomes rising
- Consumer confidence high

**2. Peak:**
- Economy at maximum output
- Low unemployment
- Inflation may rise
- Unsustainable growth

**3. Recession:**
- GDP shrinking (2+ quarters of negative growth)
- Unemployment rising
- Incomes falling
- Consumer confidence low

**4. Trough:**
- Economy at lowest point
- High unemployment
- Low spending
- Prelude to recovery

**The Problem:**

Without intervention:
- Recessions can become depressions (1930s: 25% unemployment)
- Booms can create dangerous bubbles (2008 housing bubble)
- Volatility harms families, businesses, planning

**The Goal of Stabilization Policy:**

**Countercyclical policy** = Act opposite to the cycle:
- **In recession:** Stimulate economy (increase spending, cut taxes, lower interest rates)
- **In boom/inflation:** Cool economy (cut spending, raise taxes, raise interest rates)

Result: Smoother, more stable growth

**How This Affects You:**

- Recessions: Hard to find jobs, wages stagnant, investments lose value
- Booms: Easy to find jobs, but inflation erodes purchasing power
- Stable growth: Better for planning, less financial stress

## Fiscal Policy: Government Spending and Taxation

**Fiscal Policy** = Government's use of spending and taxation to influence the economy

**Two Tools:**
1. **Government Spending** (G)
2. **Taxes** (T)

**Controlled by:** Congress and President (federal level), state legislatures ({{STATE_NAME}} level)

---

### Government Spending (G)

**Federal Government Spending (~$6 trillion/year):**

**Mandatory Spending (~65%):**
- Social Security: $1.2 trillion
- Medicare/Medicaid: $1.4 trillion
- Other entitlements: $0.7 trillion
- **Hard to change** - requires law changes

**Discretionary Spending (~30%):**
- Defense: $800 billion
- Education: $80 billion
- Transportation/infrastructure: $90 billion
- Science/research: $40 billion
- **Easier to change** - annual appropriations

**Interest on Debt (~5%):**
- $400 billion paying interest
- **Can't reduce** without paying down debt

**{{STATE_NAME}} Spending:**
- Education (largest category typically)
- Healthcare (Medicaid)
- Transportation
- Public safety
- Higher education

**How Spending Affects Economy:**

**Increased Government Spending →**
- More jobs (government hires, contractors hired)
- More income (workers spend their paychecks)
- **Multiplier effect:** Initial spending creates additional spending
- **Aggregate demand increases** → GDP rises, unemployment falls

**Example: Infrastructure Spending**
- Government spends $100 billion building roads
- Construction workers earn income
- They spend income at restaurants, stores
- Those businesses hire more workers
- Total economic impact: $150-200 billion (multiplier of 1.5-2.0)

**Decreased Government Spending →**
- Fewer jobs
- Less income
- Aggregate demand decreases → GDP falls, unemployment rises

---

### Taxation (T)

**Federal Taxes (~$4 trillion/year):**
- Income tax: 50%
- Payroll tax (Social Security, Medicare): 36%
- Corporate tax: 7%
- Other (excise, estate, etc.): 7%

**{{STATE_NAME}} Taxes:**
- Income tax (if applicable)
- Sales tax
- Property tax
- Gas tax

**How Taxes Affect Economy:**

**Tax Cuts →**
- Households have more disposable income
- Spend more (consumption increases)
- Businesses have more profit to invest
- Aggregate demand increases → GDP rises, unemployment falls

**Tax Increases →**
- Households have less disposable income
- Spend less (consumption decreases)
- Businesses have less profit to invest
- Aggregate demand decreases → GDP falls, unemployment rises

**But:** Effect depends on WHO gets tax cut
- **Low-income people:** Spend most of it (high multiplier)
- **High-income people:** Save more of it (lower multiplier)
- **Businesses:** May invest or may save (depends on confidence)

---

### Budget Deficit and Surplus

**Federal Budget:**
- **Revenue:** $4 trillion (taxes)
- **Spending:** $6 trillion
- **Deficit:** $2 trillion (spending exceeds revenue)

**Deficit** = Government spends more than it collects in taxes
- Must borrow the difference
- Issues Treasury bonds
- Adds to national debt

**Surplus** = Government collects more in taxes than it spends
- Can pay down debt
- Rare - last surplus was 2001

**National Debt:**
- Total accumulated deficits
- Currently ~$33 trillion
- ~$100,000 per person
- ~120% of GDP

**Debate:**

**Pro-Deficit in Recession:**
- Necessary to stimulate economy
- Prevents deeper recession
- Can pay it back during boom times
- Interest rates low, so borrowing is cheap

**Anti-Deficit:**
- Burdens future generations (you!)
- Interest payments crowd out other spending
- May cause inflation if too large
- Reduces flexibility for future crises

**How This Affects You:**

**Now:**
- Deficit spending during recession may save your job or create opportunities
- Government services continue even when tax revenue falls

**Future:**
- You'll pay higher taxes to service debt
- Less money available for programs you might want
- May face inflation if debt becomes unsustainable

---

### Expansionary vs. Contractionary Fiscal Policy

**Expansionary Fiscal Policy (Stimulate Economy):**

**When:** During recession (high unemployment, low growth)

**Tools:**
- **Increase government spending** (infrastructure, transfer payments)
- **Cut taxes** (put money in people's pockets)
- **Result:** Budget deficit increases

**Goal:** Increase aggregate demand → more jobs, higher GDP

**Example: 2020 COVID Recession**
- $2 trillion CARES Act (stimulus checks, unemployment benefits, business loans)
- $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan
- Massive deficit spending
- Unemployment fell from 14.7% to 3.5% in 2 years

**Contractionary Fiscal Policy (Cool Economy):**

**When:** During boom with high inflation

**Tools:**
- **Decrease government spending**
- **Raise taxes** (take money out of people's pockets)
- **Result:** Budget deficit decreases (or surplus increases)

**Goal:** Decrease aggregate demand → reduce inflation

**Rarely Used Because:**
- Politicians don't like cutting spending or raising taxes
- Voters punish them
- Easier to use monetary policy to fight inflation

---

### Fiscal Policy Challenges and Limitations

**1. Time Lags:**
- **Recognition lag:** Takes time to realize recession is happening (months)
- **Decision lag:** Congress debates, negotiates stimulus bill (months)
- **Implementation lag:** Money actually spent (months to years)
- **Total:** 6-18 months from recession start to policy impact
- By then, economy may have recovered on its own!

**2. Political Constraints:**
- Stimulus popular, austerity unpopular
- Results in deficits during recessions AND during booms
- Hard to run surpluses to pay down debt

**3. Crowding Out:**
- Government borrows money to finance deficit
- Less money available for private borrowing
- Interest rates rise (somewhat)
- Private investment may decrease
- Offsets some stimulative effect

**4. Multiplier Uncertainty:**
- Hard to predict how much additional spending each $1 of government spending generates
- Depends on confidence, propensity to consume, etc.
- Estimates range from 0.5 to 2.0

**5. Effectiveness Debate:**

**Keynesian View:**
- Fiscal policy is powerful, especially in deep recessions
- Government must step in when private sector won't spend
- Benefits exceed costs

**Classical/Libertarian View:**
- Fiscal policy is ineffective due to lags and crowding out
- Creates debt burden without much benefit
- Better to let markets self-correct

**Evidence:** Mixed, depends on circumstances

---

## Monetary Policy: The Federal Reserve

**Monetary Policy** = Federal Reserve's management of money supply and interest rates to influence the economy

**Who:** Federal Reserve (the "Fed") - independent central bank
**Chair:** Jerome Powell (appointed by President, confirmed by Senate, 4-year term)
**Structure:** 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks, Board of Governors in Washington DC

**Key Point:** Fed is INDEPENDENT of Congress and President
- Not subject to political pressure (theoretically)
- Can make unpopular decisions (raising interest rates)
- Accountability through Congressional testimony

---

### The Federal Reserve's Goals

**Dual Mandate (by law):**
1. **Maximum employment** (low unemployment)
2. **Price stability** (low, stable inflation ~2%)

**Other responsibilities:**
- Supervise banks
- Maintain financial system stability
- Provide banking services to government

**The Challenge:**
These goals sometimes conflict!
- Lowering unemployment may cause inflation
- Fighting inflation may increase unemployment
- Fed must balance (we'll explore this in L-54)

---

### Monetary Policy Tools

**Three Main Tools:**

---

#### 1. Federal Funds Rate (Most Important Tool)

**Federal Funds Rate** = Interest rate banks charge each other for overnight loans

**How it works:**
- Banks must hold reserves (deposits at Fed)
- Sometimes banks have excess reserves, sometimes shortage
- Banks with extra lend to banks with shortage
- Federal funds rate is the interest rate on these loans

**Fed's Control:**
- Fed sets TARGET rate (currently 5.25-5.50%)
- Uses open market operations to hit target
- Buys/sells Treasury bonds to add/remove money from banking system

**Why It Matters:**
- Federal funds rate influences ALL other interest rates
- Mortgage rates
- Auto loan rates
- Credit card rates
- Business loan rates
- Savings account rates

**When Fed Lowers Federal Funds Rate:**
```
Fed Funds Rate Down
    ↓
All Interest Rates Down
    ↓
Borrowing Cheaper → More borrowing
Saving Less Attractive → Less saving
    ↓
More Spending and Investment
    ↓
Aggregate Demand Increases
    ↓
GDP ↑, Unemployment ↓, Inflation ↑
```

**When Fed Raises Federal Funds Rate:**
```
Fed Funds Rate Up
    ↓
All Interest Rates Up
    ↓
Borrowing More Expensive → Less borrowing
Saving More Attractive → More saving
    ↓
Less Spending and Investment
    ↓
Aggregate Demand Decreases
    ↓
GDP ↓, Unemployment ↑, Inflation ↓
```

**How This Affects You:**

**When Rates Are Low:**
- Good for borrowers (cheap mortgages, auto loans, student loans)
- Bad for savers (low interest on savings accounts)
- Easier to find jobs (economy expanding)

**When Rates Are High:**
- Bad for borrowers (expensive mortgages, credit card debt)
- Good for savers (high interest on savings)
- Harder to find jobs (economy slowing)

---

#### 2. Reserve Requirement

**Reserve Requirement** = Percentage of deposits banks must hold in reserve (can't lend out)

**Currently:** Effectively 0% (changed in 2020)
- Used to be 10%
- Less important tool now

**How It Would Work:**
- **Lower reserve requirement** → Banks can lend more → Money supply increases
- **Raise reserve requirement** → Banks must hold more → Money supply decreases

**Rarely Changed:** Too blunt an instrument, disruptive to banks

---

#### 3. Discount Rate

**Discount Rate** = Interest rate Fed charges banks for loans from Fed

**How It Works:**
- Banks in trouble can borrow from Fed (lender of last resort)
- Discount rate is typically higher than federal funds rate
- Signals Fed's policy stance

**Changes Infrequently:** Not primary tool

---

### Expansionary vs. Contractionary Monetary Policy

**Expansionary Monetary Policy (Stimulate Economy):**

**When:** During recession (high unemployment, low growth)

**Actions:**
- **Lower federal funds rate** (make borrowing cheap)
- Encourage spending and investment

**Goal:** Increase aggregate demand → more jobs, higher GDP

**Example: 2008 Financial Crisis**
- Fed cut rates from 5.25% to 0.25%
- Kept rates near 0% for 7 years (2008-2015)
- Also used quantitative easing (bought trillions in bonds)

**Example: 2020 COVID Recession**
- Fed cut rates to 0% in March 2020
- Provided emergency loans to businesses
- Economy recovered quickly

**Contractionary Monetary Policy (Cool Economy):**

**When:** During boom with high inflation

**Actions:**
- **Raise federal funds rate** (make borrowing expensive)
- Discourage spending and investment

**Goal:** Decrease aggregate demand → reduce inflation

**Example: Early 1980s Inflation**
- Fed Chair Paul Volcker raised rates to 20% (!)
- Caused severe recession (unemployment 10%)
- But broke inflation (from 14% to 3%)
- Painful but necessary

**Example: 2022-2024 Inflation**
- Fed raised rates from 0% to 5.5%
- Slowed economy, cooling inflation
- Trying to avoid recession (soft landing)

---

### Monetary Policy Challenges and Limitations

**1. Time Lags:**
- **Recognition lag:** Fed monitors economy constantly (shorter than fiscal policy)
- **Decision lag:** Fed meets every 6 weeks, can act quickly (shorter than fiscal policy)
- **Implementation lag:** Interest rate changes affect economy over 6-18 months

**Overall:** Faster than fiscal policy but still delayed

**2. Zero Lower Bound:**
- Can't cut interest rates below 0% (or slightly negative)
- Once at zero, conventional monetary policy is exhausted
- Must use unconventional tools (quantitative easing)

**3. Inequality Effects:**
- Low interest rates boost asset prices (stocks, real estate)
- Benefits wealthy (who own assets) more than poor
- May increase wealth inequality

**4. Uncertainty:**
- Hard to know exact effect of rate changes
- Depends on confidence, expectations, global conditions
- Fed sometimes gets it wrong (too tight, too loose)

**5. Political Pressure:**
- Presidents often want low rates (boosts economy, helps reelection)
- But Fed's job is long-term stability, not short-term politics
- Independence is crucial but controversial

## Fiscal vs. Monetary Policy: Comparison

| Feature | Fiscal Policy | Monetary Policy |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Who Controls** | Congress & President | Federal Reserve |
| **Tools** | Government spending, Taxes | Interest rates, Money supply |
| **Speed** | Slow (6-18 month lags) | Faster (but still 6-18 months to full effect) |
| **Political** | Very political | Less political (independent) |
| **Flexibility** | Hard to reverse | Easier to reverse |
| **Effectiveness in Recession** | Powerful (direct spending) | Limited if rates already at zero |
| **Effectiveness Against Inflation** | Rarely used (politically unpopular) | Primary tool |
| **Side Effects** | Deficits, debt | Asset price bubbles, inequality |

**In Practice:**
- Monetary policy is FIRST line of defense (Fed acts quickly)
- Fiscal policy is BACKUP (used in severe recessions when monetary policy insufficient)
- Best results: COORDINATION between Fed and Congress

## Policy Responses to Economic Conditions

### Response to Recession

**Problem:** High unemployment, low GDP growth, falling incomes

**Fiscal Policy Response:**
- ✓ Increase government spending (infrastructure, transfer payments)
- ✓ Cut taxes (stimulus checks, payroll tax cuts)
- ✓ Accept larger deficits

**Monetary Policy Response:**
- ✓ Lower federal funds rate (make borrowing cheap)
- ✓ Quantitative easing if rates already at zero
- ✓ Forward guidance (promise to keep rates low)

**Goal:** Stimulate aggregate demand, create jobs

**Example: 2020 COVID Recession**
- Fiscal: $5 trillion in stimulus spending
- Monetary: Rates cut to 0%, massive bond buying
- Result: Quick recovery, but also inflation

---

### Response to Inflation

**Problem:** Prices rising rapidly, purchasing power declining

**Fiscal Policy Response:**
- ✓ Decrease government spending
- ✓ Raise taxes
- ✓ Reduce deficits
- **Rarely used** (politically unpopular)

**Monetary Policy Response:**
- ✓ Raise federal funds rate (make borrowing expensive)
- ✓ Reduce money supply
- ✓ Accept slower growth, higher unemployment (temporarily)

**Goal:** Reduce aggregate demand, cool price pressures

**Example: 2022-2024 Inflation**
- Fiscal: No major action (slight deficit reduction)
- Monetary: Fed raised rates from 0% to 5.5%
- Result: Inflation falling but economy slowing

---

### Policy Coordination and Conflicts

**Best Case: Fiscal and Monetary Policy Aligned**
- Both expansionary in recession
- Both contractionary during inflation
- Reinforces effects

**Problem: Policies Working Against Each Other**
- **1960s-70s:** Expansionary fiscal policy (Vietnam War, Great Society) + contractionary monetary policy = stagflation
- **2010s:** Expansionary monetary policy (low rates) + contractionary fiscal policy (austerity) = slow recovery

**Current (2024):**
- Monetary policy: Contractionary (high rates to fight inflation)
- Fiscal policy: Neutral to slightly expansionary (large deficits continuing)
- Not well coordinated

**Ideal:** Policymakers communicate and coordinate, but political realities make this hard

---

## Discussion Questions

1. **2008 Financial Crisis:** Did government do too much, too little, or just right?
   - Would economy have recovered on its own?
   - Were bailouts fair?
   - Did we create moral hazard (banks expecting future bailouts)?

2. **COVID Stimulus:** Was $5 trillion in stimulus necessary?
   - Did it prevent depression?
   - Did it cause 2022 inflation?
   - Who benefited most?

3. **National Debt:** Is $33 trillion debt a crisis?
   - Will your generation be burdened?
   - Should we pay it down now?
   - Or is it manageable if economy grows?

4. **Fed Independence:** Should Fed be independent or more accountable to elected officials?
   - Pros of independence: Long-term focus, resist political pressure
   - Cons: Unelected technocrats making huge decisions

5. **{{STATE_NAME}} Economic Policy:** How do federal policies affect {{STATE_NAME}}?
   - Interest-sensitive industries: Construction, manufacturing
   - Federal spending: Military bases, research universities
   - Your job prospects and wages

---
