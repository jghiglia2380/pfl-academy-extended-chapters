## Preparation

### Materials
- Sample contract excerpts (apartment lease, gym membership, cell phone)
- Consumer protection law reference sheets
- Contract Analyzer tool (ensure student access)
- Highlighters for contract marking activity

### Background Knowledge
Students should know:
- Basic contract elements (L-60 if covered: offer, acceptance, consideration)
- Types of common financial contracts
- Why written agreements matter

### Key Preparation Note
Many students have signed contracts without reading them or felt pressured into unfavorable agreements. Create safe space for discussing mistakes—focus on learning for future rather than shame about past decisions.

## Detailed Lesson Plan

### Hook & Introduction (5 min)

**Opening Story:**
"A college student signed up for a 'free trial' subscription that required credit card information. buried in fine print: 'Free for 7 days, then $49.99/month, 12-month minimum commitment, $299 early termination fee.' She forgot to cancel. One year = $600 she didn't intend to spend. How could this have been prevented?"

Discuss: Have you or someone you know been trapped by contract terms you didn't understand?

### Key Concepts (10 min)

**Unfair Contract Terms** (3 min)
Define and provide examples:
- One-sided modification rights
- Excessive penalties
- Broad liability waivers
- Hidden fees

**Consumer Protection Laws** (4 min)
Key protections:
- FTC Act (prohibits deceptive practices)
- Truth in Lending Act (credit disclosure)
- Magnuson-Moss (warranty protections)
- State unconscionability doctrines
- Cooling-off periods (3-day rule for door-to-door sales)

**Red Flag Language** (3 min)
Teach recognition:
- "As-is" / "No warranty"
- "Non-refundable"
- "Binding arbitration"
- "Automatic renewal"
- Broad indemnification

### Deeper Exploration (15 min)

**Systematic Contract Analysis** (7 min)
Walk through 6-step process:
1. Identify parties and obligations
2. Understand complete financial terms
3. Examine termination and modification
4. Analyze risk allocation
5. Check dispute resolution
6. Verify consistency with promises

Use real lease excerpt—project and analyze together.

**Consumer Rights Application** (8 min)
Present scenarios:
1. "As-is" used car breaks down next day—do you have recourse?
2. Credit card changes terms mid-contract—can they do that?
3. Apartment lease says landlord can enter anytime—is that legal?

For each: What consumer protection applies? What are your rights?

### Real-World Examples (8 min)

**Example 1: Taylor's Lease Analysis**
- Highlight systematic evaluation
- Emphasize negotiation success
- Point out: took lease home despite pressure

**Example 2: Marcus's Gym Membership**
- Show cost of not reading carefully
- Discuss automatic renewal traps
- Explain difficulty getting refunds after the fact

**Example 3: Jordan's Warranty Evaluation**
- Model cost-benefit analysis
- Compare warranty cost to self-insurance
- Demonstrate reading exclusions carefully

**Discussion:** What did each person do right or wrong?

### Skill Builder Introduction (5 min)

Introduce Contract Analyzer:
- Analyzes three contract types
- Identifies problematic clauses
- Provides feedback on classifications
- Teaches negotiation strategies

Students should explore during remaining time and complete for homework.

### Wrap-up (2 min)

**Key Points:**
- Read everything before signing
- Recognize red flag language
- Know your consumer rights
- Many terms are negotiable
- Walking away is powerful leverage

**Preview:** Tomorrow's Learning Lab = hands-on contract analysis, negotiation practice, consumer rights application

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Advanced Students
- Analyze complex commercial contracts
- Research state-specific consumer protection laws
- Compare contract enforceability across states
- Examine case law on unconscionability

### For Struggling Students
- Provide simplified contract excerpts
- Use highlighter strategy (green=good, yellow=concerning, red=problems)
- Partner with stronger students for analysis
- Focus on 3-4 most common red flags only

### For ELL Students
- Bilingual legal glossary
- Translated key consumer protection summaries
- Visual flowcharts for analysis process
- Extra time for reading complex contract language

## Common Misconceptions

1. **"If it's in the contract, I have to accept it"**
   - Reality: Some terms unenforceable; many negotiable

2. **"Only lawyers can understand contracts"**
   - Reality: Systematic analysis makes contracts accessible

3. **"Companies won't negotiate"**
   - Reality: Many terms are negotiable if you ask

4. **"Consumer protection laws don't really help"**
   - Reality: Strong protections exist; enforcement varies

## Assessment Opportunities

**Formative:**
- Cold call during red flag identification
- Think-pair-share on consumer rights scenarios
- Observation during skill builder exploration

**Summative:**
- Exit ticket: "Identify two red flags and explain why they're concerning"
- Contract analysis project (Day 2)
- Reflection on personal contract evaluation

## State-Specific Customization

**Note:** Consumer protection laws vary significantly by state.

Customize for your state:
- **Tenant rights:** Each state has different landlord-tenant laws (entry notice requirements, security deposit limits, etc.)
- **Cooling-off periods:** Some states extend beyond federal 3-day rule
- **Unconscionability standards:** State courts vary in enforceability thresholds
- **Arbitration limitations:** Some states restrict mandatory arbitration in consumer or employment contracts

**Action:** Reference your state's Attorney General consumer protection website and incorporate 2-3 state-specific examples.

## Extension Resources

**For Teachers:**
- FTC Consumer Protection website
- Your state Attorney General consumer resources
- NOLO legal encyclopedia (contract law basics)

**For Students:**
- "Contracts: The Essential Business Desk Reference" (NOLO)
- Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) resources

## Connections to Other L-Chapters

**Builds on:**
- L-60: Understanding Financial Contracts (if covered - basic elements)

**Connects to:**
- L-7: Credit/lending contracts
- L-30-32: Housing contracts and leases
- L-46: Auto finance agreements
- L-41-45: Employment contracts

---

**Teacher Notes:**
- Some students may have ongoing contract disputes—be sensitive but use as teaching opportunities
- Emphasize legality vs. fairness (legal ≠ fair)
- Encourage documentation (get everything in writing)
- Stress that understanding contracts is learnable skill, not innate talent
