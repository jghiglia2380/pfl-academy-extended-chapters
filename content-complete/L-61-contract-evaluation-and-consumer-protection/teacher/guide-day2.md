## Detailed Facilitation Guide

### Activity 1: Real Contract Deep-Dive (15 min)

**Setup:** "You'll analyze three complete contracts. Use the systematic framework from yesterday."

**Facilitation:**
- **Apartment Lease (7 min):** Circulate as students read. Common confusion points:
  - Security deposit refund conditions (often 15-20 items that can forfeit deposit)
  - "Reasonable wear and tear" vs. damage (vague language)
  - Notice requirements (30 day? 60 day? Written? Email ok?)

  Ask guiding questions: "What happens if you need to move for a job in 6 months?" "Can the landlord raise rent during your lease term?"

- **Gym Membership (4 min):** Students often miss:
  - Difference between advertised price and actual monthly cost with fees
  - Automatic renewal buried in fine print
  - Cancellation requiring in-person visit or certified mail

  Challenge: "Calculate the true monthly cost including all fees."

- **Cell Phone (4 min):** Key teaching moments:
  - Early termination fee calculation (often $350-$450)
  - Data overage charges can double bill
  - Arbitration clause eliminates right to sue

  Ask: "If the company suddenly raises prices 25%, what's your recourse?"

**Red Flags to Highlight:**
- One-sided termination rights
- Automatic renewal without easy cancellation
- Broad arbitration/class action waivers

### Activity 2: Consumer Rights Application (12 min)

**Facilitation Approach:**
Don't give answers—guide discovery through Consumer Rights Database.

**Scenario 1 (Bait-and-Switch):**
Students should identify:
- Truth in Lending Act violations
- Deceptive advertising (FTC Act)
- State consumer protection laws

If students struggle: "What law requires lenders to disclose true costs clearly? What does advertising '$199' but charging '$249' violate?"

**Scenario 2 (Defective Product):**
- Many students think "as-is" eliminates all rights
- Guide to implied warranty concepts
- Discuss: "Can sellers disclaim implied warranties for basic functionality?"

**Scenario 3 (Forced Arbitration):**
- Arbitration clauses often enforceable
- BUT some states limit them for certain claims
- Personal injury may be exception

**Scenario 4 (Cooling-Off Period):**
- Federal 3-day rule applies to door-to-door sales over $25
- Must be exercised properly (written notice)
- Some states have additional cooling-off periods (gyms, timeshares, etc.)

**Key Teaching Point:** Consumer protection laws provide baseline rights. Even signed contracts can't waive certain protections.

### Activity 3: Red Flag Identification (10 min)

**Teaching Strategy:** This is pattern recognition practice.

**Round 1 (Liability/Warranty):**
- Acceptable: "As-is" for used items with significant price reduction
- Unacceptable: Disclaiming liability for own negligence
- Concerning: Overly broad "any reason whatsoever" waivers

Coach students to ask: "Is this clause reasonable given the transaction? Does it go too far?"

**Round 2 (Termination/Modification):**
- Symmetric termination = fair (both parties same rights)
- Asymmetric = red flag (company can terminate freely, you can't)
- Unilateral modification rights = major red flag

**Round 3 (Financial Terms):**
Students should calculate:
- Hidden fees add 90% to advertised price in example 1
- "Fully refundable" deposit has 15 forfeiture conditions = not really refundable
- Low monthly payment hides 175% markup over item value

**Critical Teaching Moment:** Companies hide true costs through:
- Separating "base price" from mandatory fees
- Using weekly instead of monthly payments
- Extended terms that obscure total cost

### Activity 4: Negotiation Workshop (12 min)

**Part A: Negotiable vs. Non-Negotiable (4 min)**

**Teaching Point:** Almost everything is negotiable in private contracts (vs. government-regulated terms).

Generally:
- **Non-Negotiable:** Legally mandated disclosures, regulated rates (interest rate floors)
- **Negotiable:** Lease terms, fees, early termination provisions, service levels
- **Highly Negotiable:** Big-ticket items (cars, houses, employment), competitive markets

**Part B: Negotiation Scripts (4 min)**

Teach formula:
1. Express enthusiasm/commitment
2. Identify specific concern
3. Propose alternative
4. Link to standard/fairness
5. Request amendment

Bad: "I don't like this clause"
Good: "I'm ready to sign today, but this 90-day notice requirement is twice the state standard of 45 days. Can we amend to 60 days to match market norms?"

**Part C: Role-Play (4 min)**

Observe pairs—listen for:
- Are consumers specific about what they want changed?
- Are they backing up requests with reasoning?
- Are "company reps" being realistic (some flexibility but not complete capitulation)?

Debrief: "In real life, what leverage does consumer have?" (Willingness to walk away)

### Activity 5: Personal Contract Evaluation (11 min)

**Facilitation:**
This is individual and personal—circulate quietly, available for questions.

**Part A:** Students inventory their actual contracts. Many will realize they have 5-10+ active agreements they've never fully read.

**Part B:** Watch for students who say "I didn't understand anything" when signing—this is common. Normalize it and emphasize learning for next time.

**Part C:** Action plans should be SPECIFIC:
- Vague: "Read contracts better"
- Specific: "This Saturday 2-3pm, read my apartment lease completely and highlight any clauses I don't understand"

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Which current contract poses the biggest risk if you don't understand it?"
- "What's preventing you from reading it thoroughly right now?"
- "What resources would help you understand it better?"

**Common Student Insights:**
- "I have subscriptions I forgot about still charging my card"
- "I don't know how to cancel my gym membership"
- "My apartment lease auto-renewed and I didn't realize"

Validate these experiences—they're learning opportunities for developing better systems.

## Red Flags to Address

### Student Defeatism
"Companies have all the power; I can't do anything"

**Response:** "Companies need customers. Your willingness to walk away gives you power. Even when you can't change terms, you can choose providers with better contracts."

### Overwhelm
"Contracts are too long/complex for me to understand"

**Response:** "You don't need to understand every clause—focus on the systematic framework we practiced. It guides you to the critical sections."

### Over-Confidence
"I'll just never sign any contracts with these terms"

**Response:** "Sometimes you need to accept some unfavorable terms to get what you need. The goal is informed decision-making, not perfection. But knowing which terms are deal-breakers helps you negotiate or find alternatives."

## Assessment & Monitoring

**Circulate and Listen For:**

**Strong Understanding:**
- Correctly identifies multiple red flags per contract
- Explains WHY terms are unfair, not just THAT they are
- Distinguishes negotiable from non-negotiable realistically
- References specific consumer protection laws

**Developing Understanding:**
- Identifies obvious red flags ("non-refundable") but misses subtle ones
- Says terms are "unfair" without articulating specific harm
- Thinks everything is negotiable or nothing is

**Struggling:**
- Can't identify problematic terms even with guidance
- Thinks all contract terms are equally important
- Doesn't see connection between consumer rights and contract terms

**Intervention:** For struggling students, provide contract with pre-highlighted sections and ask them to classify just those clauses.

## Differentiation

### Advanced
- Analyze complex commercial or employment contracts
- Research and present on state-specific consumer protection laws
- Create comparative analysis of contracts for same service (3 gyms, 3 cell carriers)
- Examine enforceability case law

### Struggling
- Provide partially completed evaluation checklists (fill in blanks)
- Use simplified 2-page contracts instead of full agreements
- Focus on top 5 red flags only (automatic renewal, early termination fees, binding arbitration, non-refundable deposits, broad liability waivers)
- Pair with stronger student for analysis

### ELL
- Translated reference materials
- Picture-based flowcharts for analysis process
- Simplified legal vocabulary list
- Extended time for reading contracts

## State-Specific Teaching Notes

**Critical:** Consumer protection laws vary significantly by state. Customize these areas:

1. **Tenant Rights:**
   - Your state's required notice period for entry
   - Security deposit limits and return timelines
   - Rent increase restrictions
   - Landlord responsibilities for repairs

2. **Arbitration Limitations:**
   - Some states restrict mandatory arbitration in employment/consumer contracts
   - California limits arbitration in certain contexts
   - Check your state's rules

3. **Cooling-Off Periods:**
   - Federal: 3 days for door-to-door sales
   - Your state may have additional protections (gym memberships, timeshares, home improvement)

4. **Unconscionability Standards:**
   - State courts vary in how readily they invalidate unfair contracts
   - Some states very pro-consumer, others pro-business

**Action:** Spend 30 minutes before teaching to research your state's Attorney General consumer protection resources. Incorporate 2-3 state-specific examples.

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Students reluctant to participate in role-play negotiation

**Solution:** Model negotiation yourself first with willing student. Emphasize it's practice, mistakes OK. Allow students to write scripts before speaking if shy.

**Problem:** Contract Analyzer tool not loading

**Solution:** Have printed contract excerpts with guided questions as backup. Students can complete analysis manually using checklists.

**Problem:** Students finishing at very different rates

**Solution:** Early finishers can analyze additional contract from their own life or research specific consumer protection law. Slow workers can complete fewer scenarios (focus on 1-2 best examples rather than all).

## Reflection Prompts

At wrap-up, ask:
- "What contract did you realize you should read more carefully?"
- "What's one term you'll definitely negotiate next time?"
- "What surprised you about consumer protection laws?"

Listen for growth mindset responses: recognition that contract evaluation is learnable and empowering, not scary or impossible.

## Teacher Reflection

After class:
- Did students engage with actual contract analysis or resist reading?
- Were negotiation role-plays realistic or superficial?
- Did students make connections to their own contract experiences?
- What examples or activities resonated most?
- What needs more scaffolding next time?

**Remember:** Goal isn't to make students lawyers, but to develop healthy skepticism of "standard contracts," confidence to read before signing, knowledge of consumer rights, and willingness to negotiate or walk away from bad deals. These skills have lifetime value.
