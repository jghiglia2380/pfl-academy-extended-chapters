## Pre-Class Setup

1. Review systematic contract analysis steps from Day 1
2. Have a contract you've signed or might sign soon in mind (phone, subscription, etc.)
3. Access the Contract Analyzer tool
4. Have highlighter/note-taking tools ready

## Learning Lab Activities

### Activity 1: Real Contract Deep-Dive Analysis
**Time:** 15 minutes

Analyze three complete real-world contracts using systematic evaluation framework:

**Contract A: Apartment Lease (7 min)**
- Read full 8-page residential lease agreement
- Identify and highlight:
  - Security deposit terms and refund conditions
  - Early termination fees and notice requirements
  - Landlord entry rights and privacy protections
  - Maintenance responsibilities (tenant vs. landlord)
  - Automatic renewal provisions
  - Rent increase limitations or lack thereof

- Flag concerning clauses
- Determine which terms violate your state's tenant protection laws
- Rate overall fairness on 1-10 scale with justification

**Contract B: Gym Membership (4 min)**
- Read membership agreement and fine print
- Calculate total cost over advertised "initial term"
- Identify cancellation procedures and restrictions
- Note automatic renewal and billing authorization clauses
- Check for hidden fees (initiation, annual, cancellation)
- Compare advertised terms ("cancel anytime!") with actual contract

**Contract C: Cell Phone Service (4 min)**
- Read service agreement highlighting:
  - Total contract cost including all fees
  - Data limits, overage charges, and throttling policies
  - Early termination fees and calculation method
  - Company's modification rights (service changes, price increases)
  - Dispute resolution (arbitration, class action waiver)
  - Account termination rights (yours vs. theirs)

**Checkpoint:** Which contract had the most unfair terms? Which would you refuse to sign without major changes?

### Activity 2: Consumer Rights Application
**Time:** 12 minutes

Apply consumer protection laws to real scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Bait-and-Switch Tactics (3 min)**
- Car dealership advertised "$199/month lease—no money down!"
- Contract shows: $2,500 due at signing, $249/month, mandatory $1,200 maintenance package
- Which consumer protection laws apply? (Truth in Advertising, TILA)
- What remedies are available?
- How would you respond?

**Scenario 2: Defective Product with "No Warranty" Clause (3 min)**
- Purchased used appliance "as-is, no warranty"
- Appliance failed within one week
- Seller refuses refund citing "as-is" clause
- Does Magnuson-Moss Act or implied warranty law apply?
- What are your options?

**Scenario 3: Forced Arbitration for Serious Harm (3 min)**
- Signed apartment lease with mandatory arbitration clause
- Suffered serious injury from landlord's negligence (failed to repair known hazard)
- Arbitration clause waives right to jury trial
- Is this enforceable for personal injury claims in your state?
- What consumer protections might apply?

**Scenario 4: Cooling-Off Period Rights (3 min)**
- Signed expensive home improvement contract during high-pressure door-to-door sales pitch
- Next day, realized price is 3x market rate
- Contract says "all sales final"
- Does 3-day cooling-off period apply?
- How do you exercise cancellation rights?

Use Consumer Rights Database to research applicable laws and determine proper course of action for each scenario.

### Activity 3: Red Flag Identification Challenge
**Time:** 10 minutes

Review contract excerpts and identify/classify red flags:

**Round 1: Liability and Warranty Disclaimers (3 min)**
Read five clauses, classify each as Acceptable, Concerning, or Unacceptable:

1. "Product sold as-is with no warranty of any kind" [Used car, $15,000]
2. "Company not liable for any damages including those caused by our negligence"
3. "Limited warranty covers defects for 90 days; excludes consequential damages"
4. "Customer waives all claims against Company for any reason whatsoever"
5. "Implied warranties of merchantability and fitness limited to 1 year"

**Round 2: Termination and Modification (3 min)**
Evaluate these contract provisions:

1. "Either party may terminate with 30 days notice"
2. "Company may terminate anytime without cause; Customer must provide 90 days notice and pay $500 fee"
3. "Company may change any terms by posting notice on website; continued use = acceptance"
4. "Annual contract with month-to-month rollover after initial term"
5. "Lifetime membership, non-refundable, Company may change services or revoke membership at will"

**Round 3: Financial and Payment Terms (4 min)**
Calculate true costs and identify problems:

1. Service advertised as "$9.99/month" but contract shows: $9.99 + $2.99 processing fee + $4.99 convenience fee + taxes = $19/month actual cost
2. "$500 deposit, fully refundable" but fine print lists 15 conditions that forfeit deposit
3. "Low monthly payment of $50" [for 84 months = $4,200 total for $1,800 item]
4. "Automatic billing authorization grants Company right to charge your account for any amounts we determine you owe"
5. "Price guaranteed for first 6 months, then market rate" [contract is 24 months, early termination = $400]

For each, calculate hidden costs and explain why it's problematic.

### Activity 4: Negotiation Strategy Workshop
**Time:** 12 minutes

Develop negotiation approaches for problematic contract terms:

**Part A: Identify Negotiable vs. Non-Negotiable (4 min)**

For each contract type, classify terms as:
- **Non-Negotiable** (standard, legally required, or company won't budge)
- **Negotiable** (possible to change with push-back)
- **Highly Negotiable** (company expects negotiation)

**Apartment Lease:**
- Rent amount: ___
- Security deposit amount: ___
- Lease duration: ___
- Pet policy: ___
- Early termination fee: ___
- Automatic renewal period: ___

**Employment Contract:**
- Base salary: ___
- Job duties: ___
- Non-compete clause duration: ___
- Non-compete geographic restriction: ___
- Intellectual property assignment: ___
- Severance terms: ___

**Service Contract:**
- Monthly price: ___
- Contract length: ___
- Early termination fee: ___
- Service level guarantees: ___
- Automatic renewal: ___
- Arbitration clause: ___

**Part B: Develop Negotiation Scripts (4 min)**

For three problematic clauses, write negotiation approaches:

**Example Problem:** 90-day lease termination notice requirement

**Weak Response:** "Can we make it 60 days instead?"

**Strong Response:** "I'm excited about this apartment, but state law allows 60-day notice and that's the standard I'm seeing elsewhere. Can we amend this clause to 60 days? I'm ready to sign today if we can agree on that."

**Practice Scenarios:**
1. $500 early gym membership termination fee (annual dues are $40/month)
2. Employment contract's 2-year non-compete covering entire industry in 5-state region
3. Automatic price increase clause: "Price may increase up to 15% annually"

Write strong negotiation language for each.

**Part B: Role-Play Negotiation (4 min)**

Pair up. One person = consumer, other = company representative.

**Scenario:** Cell phone contract with:
- $350 early termination fee
- Company can change plan/price with 30 days notice
- Mandatory 2-year commitment
- Automatic renewal for 2 more years unless canceled 60 days before end

Consumer goal: Negotiate better terms
Company goal: Make some concessions while protecting business interests

Role-play 3-minute negotiation, then switch roles and repeat with different scenario.

### Activity 5: Personal Contract Evaluation
**Time:** 11 minutes

Apply skills to actual or anticipated contracts in your life:

**Part A: Contract Inventory (3 min)**
List contracts you currently have or anticipate signing soon:
- Current: ___
- Within 6 months: ___
- Within 1 year: ___

Examples: Phone plan, streaming subscriptions, apartment lease, car insurance, gym membership, credit cards

**Part B: Priority Analysis (3 min)**
Select one current and one anticipated contract. For each:

1. What were/are the most important terms for you?
2. What terms did you not understand when signing (or won't understand)?
3. What would you negotiate if you could go back (or will negotiate)?
4. What red flags should you watch for?
5. What consumer protections apply?

**Part C: Action Plan (5 min)**
Create specific plan for one contract:

**For Current Contract:**
- Review it thoroughly this week (schedule specific time)
- Identify any problematic terms you missed
- Research if you have grounds to dispute or renegotiate
- Set calendar reminder for renewal/cancellation deadlines
- Plan: Continue, attempt to renegotiate, or cancel?

**For Anticipated Contract:**
- Research standard terms for this type of agreement
- Identify which terms are typically negotiable
- Prepare questions to ask before signing
- Draft proposed amendments for problematic clauses
- Determine your walk-away conditions (what terms would make you decline?)
- Find alternatives if this contract has unacceptable terms

- One term you will definitely negotiate in future contracts
- One consumer protection law you didn't know about before today

## Key Takeaways

1. **Systematic Analysis Works:** Using structured evaluation (parties, financial terms, termination, liability, dispute resolution) ensures you don't miss critical details. Contracts are designed to be skimmed; you must read deliberately.

2. **Many Terms Are Negotiable:** Despite being presented as "standard" or "non-negotiable," many contract terms can be modified if you ask. Companies expect negotiation on major agreements. Your willingness to push back can result in substantially better terms.

3. **Consumer Laws Protect You:** You have rights that cannot be contracted away. Unconscionability doctrines, cooling-off periods, warranty protections, and prohibitions on deceptive practices provide safeguards even when contracts claim otherwise.

4. **Red Flags Demand Scrutiny:** Certain language (as-is, non-refundable, binding arbitration, automatic renewal, broad liability waivers) should trigger careful analysis. These terms often hide the most unfavorable provisions.

5. **Walking Away Is Powerful:** Your best negotiating leverage is willingness to decline bad deals. If a contract has terms you find unacceptable and the company won't negotiate, finding an alternative provider protects you and signals to companies that unfair terms cost them business.

**Before Next Class:** Find one contract you've signed. Read it completely. Identify three terms you didn't fully understand when you signed it. Research whether those terms are standard or excessive. Come prepared to discuss what you discovered and whether you would have negotiated differently.
