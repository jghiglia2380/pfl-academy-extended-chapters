# L-49: Scarcity, Opportunity Cost, and Incentives
## Day 2: Applying Opportunity Cost Analysis - Learning Lab

### Learning Objectives
By the end of today's Learning Lab, you will be able to:
- Apply opportunity cost analysis to major life decisions (college, career, housing)
- Evaluate trade-offs in personal budget allocation
- Design incentive systems that align with personal financial goals
- Assess how {{STATE_NAME}} policies create incentives that affect personal finance

---

## Opening Reflection (5 minutes)

**Write:** Think about a significant financial decision you'll need to make in the next 1-5 years. It could be:
- Whether to attend college or pursue alternatives
- Which career path to follow
- Whether to buy a car or use alternative transportation
- How to allocate money between spending, saving, and investing
- Whether to live at home or move out

**Question:** What are you giving up by making that choice? What's the opportunity cost?

Keep this decision in mind as we work through today's activities.

## Learning Lab Activities

### Activity 1: College vs. Alternative Paths Opportunity Cost Analysis (20 minutes)

**Objective:** Calculate the full economic cost (explicit + implicit) of different post-high school paths.

#### Scenario: Your friend Alex is deciding between three paths after high school graduation.

**Path A: 4-Year Public University in {{STATE_NAME}}**
- Tuition: {{STATE_TUITION_PUBLIC}}/year
- Room & board: $12,000/year (if living on campus) OR $0 (if living at home)
- Books & supplies: $1,200/year
- Duration: 4 years
- Can work part-time: $12,000/year
- Expected starting salary after graduation: $55,000/year

**Path B: Trade School/Apprenticeship**
- Tuition: $8,000/year (2 years)
- Can work part-time during school: $20,000/year
- Apprenticeship pays: $35,000/year during training
- Duration: 2 years school + 2 years apprenticeship
- Expected salary after completion: $50,000/year (Year 5)

**Path C: Immediately Enter Workforce**
- Starting salary: $30,000/year
- Advancement after 4 years: $38,000/year
- No tuition costs
- Full-time work from Day 1

#### Your Task: Complete the Comparison Analysis

**Part A: Calculate Total Costs for Path A (4-Year University)**

| Cost Category | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | **4-Year Total** |
|--------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Tuition | {{STATE_TUITION_PUBLIC}} | {{STATE_TUITION_PUBLIC}} | {{STATE_TUITION_PUBLIC}} | {{STATE_TUITION_PUBLIC}} | ____________ |
| Room & board | _______ | _______ | _______ | _______ | ____________ |
| Books/supplies | $1,200 | $1,200 | $1,200 | $1,200 | ____________ |
| **Explicit Costs Subtotal** | | | | | ____________ |
| | | | | | |
| Opportunity Cost (forgone full-time income) | | | | | |
| - Could have earned full-time | $30,000 | $30,000 | $30,000 | $30,000 | $120,000 |
| - Minus part-time earnings | -$12,000 | -$12,000 | -$12,000 | -$12,000 | -$48,000 |
| **Net Opportunity Cost** | | | | | **$72,000** |
| | | | | | |
| **TOTAL ECONOMIC COST** | | | | | ____________ |

**Part B: Calculate Path B (Trade School + Apprenticeship)**

| Cost Category | Year 1-2 (School) | Year 3-4 (Apprenticeship) | **4-Year Total** |
|--------------|------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| Tuition | $8,000/year | $0 | ____________ |
| Part-time income during school | -$20,000/year | N/A | ____________ |
| Apprenticeship income | N/A | -$35,000/year | ____________ |
| **Net Cost/Income** | | | ____________ |
| | | | |
| Opportunity Cost (vs. full-time work) | | | |
| - Could have earned | $30,000/year × 2 | $30,000/year × 2 | $120,000 |
| - Minus actual earnings | -$20,000/year × 2 | -$35,000/year × 2 | -$110,000 |
| **Net Opportunity Cost** | | | **$10,000** |
| | | | |
| **TOTAL ECONOMIC COST** | | | ____________ |

**Part C: Calculate Path C (Immediate Workforce)**

| Cost Category | 4-Year Total |
|--------------|--------------|
| Explicit Costs | $0 |
| Opportunity Cost | $0 (this is the baseline) |
| **Income Earned (Years 1-4)** | ____________ |

**Part D: Long-Term Comparison (10-Year Outlook)**

Now calculate total earnings for each path over 10 years:

| Path | Years 1-4 Net | Years 5-10 Earnings | **10-Year Net** |
|------|--------------|---------------------|----------------|
| A: University | (Calculated above) | $55,000 × 6 years = $330,000 | ____________ |
| B: Trade School | (Calculated above) | $50,000 × 6 years = $300,000 | ____________ |
| C: Workforce | $30k × 3 + $38k × 1 = $128,000 | $38,000 × 6 years = $228,000 | ____________ |

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Which path has the lowest opportunity cost in the first 4 years? Why?
2. Which path results in the highest total wealth after 10 years?
3. What factors beyond money should Alex consider (job satisfaction, physical demands, flexibility, growth potential)?
4. How would your analysis change if university tuition doubled? If trade school apprenticeship paid $45,000/year?
5. How does this analysis apply to YOUR post-high school decision?

**Key Insight:** The path with the highest short-term cost (university) might have the lowest long-term opportunity cost if it leads to significantly higher earnings. But this isn't guaranteed—it depends on field of study, career outcomes, and individual circumstances.

### Activity 2: Monthly Budget Opportunity Cost Analysis (15 minutes)

**Objective:** Apply opportunity cost thinking to everyday spending decisions.

#### Scenario: You have a part-time job earning $1,200/month. Your expenses and financial goals are below.

**Required Expenses:**
- Phone bill: $50/month
- Car insurance: $150/month (you drive parents' car)
- Gas: $80/month
- Personal items: $50/month
- **Total Required: $330/month**

**Discretionary Income: $870/month**

**Your Goals:**
- Save for a car ($8,000 needed, you have $2,000 saved)
- Build emergency fund ($1,500 target)
- Save for college or training
- Enjoy social activities with friends
- Buy clothes and entertainment

#### Your Task: Allocate Your $870 and Analyze Trade-offs

**Budget Allocation Table:**

| Category | Monthly Amount | Annual Total | Opportunity Cost (What You're Giving Up) |
|----------|----------------|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| Emergency Fund | $_______ | $_______ | __________________________________ |
| Car Savings | $_______ | $_______ | __________________________________ |
| College/Training Savings | $_______ | $_______ | __________________________________ |
| Entertainment/Social | $_______ | $_______ | __________________________________ |
| Clothing/Shopping | $_______ | $_______ | __________________________________ |
| Other: _________ | $_______ | $_______ | __________________________________ |
| **TOTAL** | **$870** | **$10,440** | |

**Analysis Questions:**

1. **If you allocate $300/month to car savings:**
   - How many months until you can buy the car? ___________
   - Opportunity cost: $300/month could instead earn ___% in a high-yield savings account = $_______ interest over that period
   - Alternative: What if you delayed the car purchase by 6 months and invested that money?

2. **If you allocate $200/month to entertainment:**
   - Annual total: $2,400
   - Opportunity cost: If invested at 8% annual return instead, in 5 years this would be worth: $__________
   - Is the enjoyment today worth more than $__________ in 5 years? (There's no right answer—depends on your values)

3. **Emergency Fund Priority:**
   - If you prioritize emergency fund ($150/month), you'll reach $1,500 goal in _______ months
   - Opportunity cost: During this time, you're not maximizing car savings or investments
   - Benefit: Financial security and avoiding high-interest debt in emergencies
   - Is it worth it? ___________

4. **The 50/30/20 Rule Application:**
   - 50% to needs (required expenses): $330 ✓
   - 30% to wants: 30% of $1,200 = $360
   - 20% to savings/debt: 20% of $1,200 = $240

   Does your allocation follow this guideline? If not, why did you choose differently?

**Partner Discussion (5 minutes):**
- Share your budget allocation with a partner
- Explain your reasoning and what you're prioritizing
- Discuss: How do your opportunity costs differ based on your goals?

**Reflection:**
- Did thinking about opportunity costs change how you allocated money?
- What surprised you about the trade-offs?
- How might you adjust your real budget based on this analysis?

- [ ] Other: _______________________

**Design Your Incentive System:**

| Incentive Element | Your Design |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Goal** | Be specific: _________________________ |
| | |
| **Positive Incentives** (rewards for progress): | |
| - Small milestone reward | When I reach ___%, I will ____________ |
| - Medium milestone reward | When I reach ___%, I will ____________ |
| - Goal completion reward | When I complete the goal, I will _______ |
| | |
| **Negative Incentives** (consequences for falling short): | |
| - If I don't hit weekly target | I must __________________________ |
| - If I spend outside budget | I must __________________________ |
| - Accountability partner | _____________ will check my progress |
| | |
| **Structural Incentives** (make it easier to succeed): | |
| - Automate savings | Set up automatic transfer of $______/week |

**Examples from {{STATE_NAME}} Residents:**

**Example 1: Marcus (Saving for Car)**
- **Goal:** Save $3,000 in 6 months
- **Positive:** Every $500 saved = dinner out at favorite restaurant
- **Negative:** If he misses weekly goal, he skips his favorite streaming service that week
- **Structural:** Automatic $115/week transfer to separate savings account, can't access with debit card
- **Social:** Told his sister his goal; she texts him every Friday to check progress

**Example 2: Aisha (Reducing Spending)**
- **Goal:** Cut discretionary spending from $400/month to $250/month
- **Positive:** Save $150/month × 12 = $1,800/year; reward herself with $300 vacation using savings
- **Negative:** Uses cash-only system for discretionary spending; when it's gone, it's gone
- **Structural:** Deleted food delivery apps, unsubscribed from marketing emails
- **Social:** Joins "No-Spend Challenge" with friends; they support each other

**Discussion:**
1. Which type of incentive (positive, negative, structural, social) is most powerful for YOU? Why?
2. How do your incentives align with your values and personality?
3. What incentives have you seen work in {{STATE_NAME}} programs (school, work, sports, etc.)?

## Summary & Key Takeaways

### What We Applied Today:

✓ **Opportunity cost analysis for major decisions** - Comparing college, trade school, and workforce paths requires analyzing both explicit costs and forgone alternatives

✓ **Budget trade-offs** - Every dollar allocated to one goal can't be used for another; understanding opportunity costs helps prioritize spending

✓ **Incentive system design** - Creating positive, negative, structural, and social incentives helps achieve financial goals

✓ **{{STATE_NAME}} policy incentives** - Understanding how government creates incentives allows you to take advantage of programs and predict policy effects

✓ **Framework for decision-making** - Always ask: "What am I giving up?" before making financial choices

### Connecting to L-48 and L-49:

**From L-48 (Economic Systems):**
- Property rights create incentives for wealth-building
- {{STATE_NAME}}'s mixed economy uses both market incentives and government programs
- Resource allocation depends on incentive structures

**From L-49 Day 1:**
- Scarcity forces choices
- Every choice has an opportunity cost
- Incentives drive behavior

**Key Insight:**
Economic systems (L-48) exist because of scarcity (L-49). Understanding opportunity costs helps you navigate {{STATE_NAME}}'s mixed economy and make optimal financial decisions given your constraints.
