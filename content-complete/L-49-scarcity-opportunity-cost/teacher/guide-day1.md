# L-49: Scarcity, Opportunity Cost, and Incentives
## Teacher Guide - Day 1

### Lesson Overview
Students learn the foundational economic concept of scarcity and develop fluency in opportunity cost analysis. They explore how incentives drive behavior and connect these concepts back to L-48's economic systems framework.

**Total Time:** 55 minutes
**Format:** Direct instruction with interactive examples and discussions
**Key Concept:** Scarcity is the fundamental economic problem; opportunity cost is the true cost of every decision; incentives explain behavior

## Detailed Facilitation Guide

### Opening Activity (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Establish that scarcity is universal and personal

**Facilitation Steps:**
1. "Take out paper. You have 2 minutes: List EVERYTHING you want in the next year."
2. Set timer. Students write silently.
3. "Now add up the time and money required for everything on your list."
4. Ask: "Do you have enough time and money for all of it?" (No one will)
5. Transition: "Welcome to scarcity—the fundamental economic problem that drives ALL of economics."

**Expected Responses:**
- Students will list: phones, cars, vacations, college, time with friends, sleep, money, etc.
- Most will realize quickly they can't afford/don't have time for everything
- Some students will try to game it ("I'll work more!") - point out time scarcity

**Differentiation:**
- **Struggling students:** Provide categories to prompt thinking (possessions, experiences, time, relationships, goals)
- **Advanced students:** Ask them to estimate actual costs and compare to realistic income/time available

**Teaching Tip:**
Students often think scarcity = poverty. **Clarify immediately:** "Scarcity affects everyone, even billionaires. Bill Gates has limited time. Even if you won the lottery, you'd still face trade-offs and opportunity costs."

### Scarcity: The Fundamental Problem (10 minutes)

**Objective:** Students understand scarcity as unlimited wants + limited resources

**Facilitation Steps:**

**Part 1: Define Scarcity (3 minutes)**
1. Write on board: **Scarcity = Unlimited Wants + Limited Resources**
2. "Everyone wants more than they have time, money, or energy for."
3. Key categories of scarcity:
   - **Time:** 24 hours/day, 168 hours/week (fixed, non-renewable)
   - **Money:** Limited by income, wealth, access to credit
   - **Energy:** Physical and mental capacity
   - **Attention:** Can't focus on everything
4. "Even {{STATE_NAME}} faces scarcity—limited tax revenue must cover education, infrastructure, healthcare, public safety, etc."

**Part 2: Time Scarcity Exercise (4 minutes)**
1. Display time breakdown on board:
   - 168 hours/week total
   - Sleep: 56 hours (8/night)
   - School: 40 hours
   - Eating/hygiene: 21 hours
   - **Remaining: 51 hours for EVERYTHING else**
2. "51 hours for: work, homework, family, friends, exercise, hobbies, entertainment, chores"
3. Ask: "Is 51 hours enough?" (No!)
4. "This is time scarcity. You must choose."

**Part 3: Connect to L-48 (3 minutes)**
1. "Remember yesterday (L-48): We asked 'What should we produce? How? For whom?'"
2. "**Why do we need economic systems to answer those questions?**"
3. Wait for responses, then: "**Because of scarcity.** Systems exist to allocate scarce resources."
4. "Markets use prices. Command economies use central planning. Both are responding to scarcity."

**Monitoring:**
- Are students distinguishing between scarcity (universal) and shortage (temporary, specific)?
- Check understanding: "Thumbs up if you can explain scarcity in your own words. Thumbs sideways if you're still working on it."

**Common Misconception:**
**"Scarcity only affects poor people."**
- **Address:** "Beyoncé is worth $800M. Does she face scarcity?" (Yes—limited time, must choose between competing opportunities)
- **Key Point:** Scarcity ≠ Poverty. Scarcity = Constraint. Everyone faces constraints.

### Opportunity Cost Analysis (15 minutes)

**Objective:** Students can calculate opportunity cost and distinguish explicit from implicit costs

**Facilitation Steps:**

**Part 1: Introduce Opportunity Cost (5 minutes)**
1. **Definition:** "Opportunity cost = Value of your next best alternative"
2. **Key insight:** "Every choice means giving something up."
3. **Example 1: Friday Night**
   - You have $30 and Friday night free
   - Options: Movie ($30), Work shift ($60 earned), Study (free)
   - If you choose movie:
     - Explicit cost: $30 spent
     - Opportunity cost: $60 you could have earned (or better grade from studying)
     - **Total economic cost: $30 + $60 = $90**
4. Ask class: "Why is the total cost $90, not just $30?"
   - Listen for understanding that forgone earnings count
5. "Most people only look at explicit costs. Smart financial thinkers analyze opportunity costs."

**Part 2: College Opportunity Cost Example ({{STATE_NAME}} Specific) (7 minutes)**
1. "Let's analyze: Should you go to college in {{STATE_NAME}}?"
2. **Explicit Costs (what you pay):**
   - Tuition: {{STATE_TUITION_PUBLIC}}/year × 4 years
   - Books: $1,200/year × 4
   - Housing: (varies if living at home vs. on campus)
3. **Implicit Costs (what you give up):**
   - Forgone earnings: If you worked full-time at $35,000/year × 4 = $140,000
   - Minus part-time earnings during college: -$60,000
   - **Net opportunity cost: $80,000**
4. Write on board:
   ```
   Total Economic Cost of College =
   Explicit costs (tuition + books + housing) +
   Opportunity costs (forgone earnings)
   ```
5. "But wait—what's the opportunity cost of NOT going to college?"
   - Lower lifetime earnings (college grads earn ~$1M more)
   - Fewer career options
   - Less economic mobility
6. **Key Teaching Point:** "You can't escape opportunity costs. Every choice has trade-offs. The question is: Which trade-off is worth it?"

**Part 3: Explicit vs. Implicit Costs (3 minutes)**
1. Create T-chart on board:

| Explicit Costs | Implicit Costs |
|---------------|----------------|
| Out-of-pocket payments | Value of forgone alternatives |
| Easy to measure | Harder to measure |
| Shows in bank account | Doesn't show (but still real) |
| Example: Tuition | Example: Forgone earnings |

2. "Which is usually larger: explicit or implicit costs?"
   - Answer: **Implicit costs** (especially time-related opportunity costs)
3. Ask students to identify explicit vs. implicit in scenarios:
   - Buying a car vs. using public transportation
   - Taking a vacation vs. working overtime
   - Keeping $10,000 in checking account vs. investing it

**Monitoring:**
- Are students correctly identifying opportunity costs?
- Do they understand that opportunity cost = next best alternative (not all alternatives)?
- Can they distinguish explicit from implicit costs?

**Formative Assessment:**
Quick check: "What's the opportunity cost of staying after school for play rehearsal?"
- Expected: Time you could have worked/studied/relaxed
- Watch for students who list only explicit costs

### Incentives and Behavior (15 minutes)

**Objective:** Students understand how incentives motivate action and connect to economic systems

**Facilitation Steps:**

**Part 1: Define Incentives (3 minutes)**
1. **Definition:** "Incentive = something that motivates a person to act"
2. **Two types:**
   - **Positive incentives:** Rewards (bonuses, tax deductions, discounts, praise)
   - **Negative incentives:** Penalties (fines, fees, bad grades, social disapproval)
3. **Key Principle:** "People respond to incentives because they're trying to maximize benefits and minimize costs (including opportunity costs)"

**Part 2: Incentives in Different Economic Systems (7 minutes)**
**Connect back to L-48:**
1. "Remember yesterday we compared market, command, and mixed economies?"
2. "Let's understand WHY they produce different outcomes. It's all about incentives."

**Market Economy ({{STATE_NAME}}):**
- **Property rights incentive:** You keep what you earn → motivation to work hard, innovate, take risks
- **Profit incentive:** Businesses keep profits → improve products, reduce costs, serve customers
- **Price incentive:** High prices signal scarcity → producers make more, consumers use less
- **Competition incentive:** Must beat competitors → innovation, quality, customer service

**Command Economy:**
- **Weak property rights:** State takes most profits → less motivation
- **No profit incentive:** Everyone paid same → "We pretend to work, they pretend to pay us"
- **No price signals:** Can't know what people want → shortages and surpluses
- **No competition:** Monopoly providers → poor quality, bad service

3. **Classic Example: Soviet Nail Factory**
   - **Story:** Factory was given quota: "Produce 10,000 nails"
   - **Result:** Made 10,000 tiny, useless nails
   - **Why?** Incentive was quantity, not quality or usefulness
   - **Lesson:** "Bad incentives → bad outcomes. Design matters."

**Part 3: Real-World Incentive Examples (5 minutes)**
1. Go through examples from student content:
   - **401(k) tax deduction** → People save more for retirement
   - **Overtime pay (1.5×)** → People work extra hours
   - **Late fees on credit cards** → People pay on time
   - **College scholarships for good grades** → Students study harder

2. **{{STATE_NAME}} Specific:**
   - "{{STATE_NAME}} offers {{STATE_TAX_INCENTIVES}}"
   - "These create incentives for certain behaviors"
   - Ask: "Who benefits? What behavior does it encourage?"

3. **Unintended Consequences Example: Cobra Bounties**
   - Tell story from student content (colonial India, cobra breeding)
   - **Key Point:** "Always ask: How will people ACTUALLY respond to this incentive? Sometimes it backfires."

**Class Discussion Prompt:**
"Think of an incentive in your life (school, work, sports, family). Does it work? Why or why not?"
- Take 2-3 student examples
- Analyze: Is it positive or negative? Does it align with desired behavior?

**Monitoring:**
- Are students connecting incentives to economic systems?
- Do they see how property rights create different incentive structures?
- Can they predict behavioral responses to incentives?

### Application to {{STATE_NAME}} (7 minutes)

**Objective:** Students apply concepts to their actual environment

**Facilitation Steps:**

**Part 1: {{STATE_NAME}} Policy Incentives (4 minutes)**
1. "Let's look at how {{STATE_NAME}} uses opportunity costs and incentives in policy"

**Example 1: Minimum Wage**
- {{STATE_NAME}} minimum wage: {{STATE_MIN_WAGE}}
- **Intended incentive:** Ensure workers earn livable wage
- **Your opportunity cost of leisure:** Each hour not working = {{STATE_MIN_WAGE}} forgone
- **Business opportunity cost:** Higher labor costs → maybe hire fewer workers, automate, or raise prices
- **Trade-off:** Higher wages vs. potentially fewer jobs (this is debated by economists)

**Example 2: College Tuition**
- Public university tuition in {{STATE_NAME}}: {{STATE_TUITION_PUBLIC}}
- **Incentive effect:** Relatively affordable → more people attend college
- **State's opportunity cost:** Money spent on higher education can't be spent on K-12, infrastructure, healthcare
- Ask: "Should {{STATE_NAME}} subsidize college more? Less? Why?"

**Part 2: Personal Application (3 minutes)**
1. "How can you use {{STATE_NAME}}'s incentive policies to your advantage?"
2. Examples:
   - Tax deductions for 529 college savings plans
   - First-time homebuyer programs
   - Job training grants
   - State tax credits
3. "Understanding these policies helps you minimize your opportunity costs (taxes, expenses) and maximize benefits"

**Extension for Advanced Students:**
"Research: How does {{STATE_NAME}} rank nationally in economic freedom, business climate, or tax burden? How do these rankings affect job opportunities and career prospects?"

---

### Discussion & Day 2 Preview (3 minutes)

**Facilitation Steps:**
1. **Quick Review:**
   - "Scarcity is universal—unlimited wants, limited resources"
   - "Opportunity cost = value of next best alternative"
   - "Explicit costs are what you pay; implicit costs (opportunity costs) are usually larger"
   - "Incentives drive behavior in predictable ways"
   - "Economic systems (L-48) differ in their incentive structures"

2. **Check for Understanding:**
   - "Who can give me an example of opportunity cost from your own life?"
   - Take 1-2 responses

3. **Preview Day 2:**
   - "Tomorrow: Learning Lab. You'll apply these concepts to real decisions:"
     - Calculate opportunity costs for college vs. alternative paths
     - Analyze monthly budget trade-offs
     - Design incentive systems for your goals
     - Evaluate {{STATE_NAME}} policy incentives
   - "Bring your critical thinking—we're making these concepts practical and personal"

4. **Homework (Optional):**
   - "Think about a major financial decision you'll face in the next 1-5 years"
   - "We'll analyze it tomorrow using opportunity cost framework"

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Struggling Students:
- Focus on one or two clear examples rather than many complex scenarios
- Use concrete situations from their daily life (choosing between work shifts and social events)
- Provide calculation templates for opportunity cost problems
- Partner with stronger student for discussions
- Offer sentence frames: "The opportunity cost of ___ is ___ because ___"

### For Advanced Students:
- Assign research: Compare opportunity costs of different career paths using BLS data
- Analyze historical policy changes and their incentive effects
- Calculate opportunity cost of inflation (money in checking account losing value)
- Explore behavioral economics: When do people ignore opportunity costs?
- Read: "Freakonomics" chapter on incentives or similar accessible economics writing

### For ELL Students:
- Pre-teach vocabulary: scarcity, opportunity cost, explicit, implicit, incentive, trade-off
- Provide bilingual glossary
- Use visual aids: charts, diagrams, real photos of scenarios
- Allow native language discussion before English reporting
- Use gestures and physical examples (choosing between two items)

### For Students with IEPs:
- Extended time on written responses
- Audio recordings of key explanations
- Graphic organizers for comparing explicit vs. implicit costs
- Calculator use for all numerical problems
- Reduce number of examples (focus on depth over breadth)

## Common Misconceptions & How to Address

**Misconception 1:** "Scarcity only affects poor people"
- **Address:** Use billionaire examples (Elon Musk has limited time; must choose between SpaceX, Tesla, Twitter). Everyone faces constraints.

**Misconception 2:** "Opportunity cost = everything I give up"
- **Address:** Clarify: It's the value of the NEXT BEST alternative, not all alternatives. If you go to a movie instead of working or studying, the opportunity cost is whichever of those two is more valuable to you.

**Misconception 3:** "I can avoid opportunity costs by choosing carefully"
- **Address:** "No! Every choice has opportunity costs. You can't escape them. The question is which trade-off is worth it."

**Misconception 4:** "Only money matters in opportunity cost"
- **Address:** "Time is often the bigger opportunity cost. Also consider: relationships, health, happiness, learning, experiences."

**Misconception 5:** "Incentives always work"
- **Address:** Use cobra bounty example to show unintended consequences. Also discuss: Some people don't respond strongly to financial incentives if other values dominate.

## Assessment Opportunities

### Formative Assessment:
- **Opening activity:** Are students identifying personal scarcity?
- **Cold calling:** Randomly select students to define key terms or identify opportunity costs
- **Think-Pair-Share:** "What's the opportunity cost of taking AP classes?" (Students discuss in pairs, then share)
- **Thumb check:** "Thumbs up if you can calculate opportunity cost. Sideways if you're still practicing. Down if you're lost."

### Summative Assessment (Day 2):
- Completed opportunity cost calculations for college/career decisions
- Budget allocation analysis with trade-off explanations
- Incentive system design for personal goal
- {{STATE_NAME}} policy analysis

---

## Materials Needed

- Whiteboard/markers for examples and T-charts
- Timer for time scarcity demonstration
- Optional: Calculator for students (opportunity cost calculations)
- Optional: Recent news examples of {{STATE_NAME}} policy changes with incentive effects
- Access to student content (digital or printed)

---

- Mixed economies balance competing priorities (trade-offs)

**To L-50 (Two Days from Now):**
- Supply and demand curves reflect opportunity costs
- Price changes signal changing opportunity costs
- Market equilibrium balances trade-offs
- {{STATE_NAME}} markets (housing, labor, goods) respond to scarcity

**To L-51 (Market Structures):**
- Incentives differ across market structures (competition vs. monopoly)
- Market power affects opportunity costs for consumers

**To L-52 (Government and the Economy):**
- Government policies create incentives and opportunity costs
- Taxation, regulation, and spending involve trade-offs
- {{STATE_NAME}} budget decisions reflect opportunity costs

---

## Extension Activities (Optional)

1. **Opportunity Cost Calculator:**
   - Students create Excel or Google Sheets template for comparing financial decisions
   - Include fields for explicit costs, implicit costs, total economic cost
   - Apply to real decisions they face

2. **{{STATE_NAME}} Policy Debate:**
   - Assign students different policy proposals (raising minimum wage, free college tuition, tax cuts)
   - Analyze incentives created and opportunity costs for different groups
   - Formal debate or written position papers

3. **Historical Case Studies:**
   - Soviet Union central planning failures (incentive problems)
   - Prohibition in USA (unintended incentive consequences)
   - China's economic reforms (changing incentive structures)

4. **Personal Budget Project:**
   - Students track all spending for one week
   - Calculate opportunity costs of major purchases
   - Redesign budget based on priorities and opportunity cost analysis

---

## Notes for Next Year

- **Timing:** Opportunity cost section often runs long (students find it fascinating). Consider expanding to 20 minutes and shortening opening.
- **Examples:** Update {{STATE_NAME}}-specific data annually (tuition, minimum wage, tax incentives).
- **Engagement:** Friday night example resonates well—students immediately understand the trade-offs. Consider adding more age-appropriate scenarios.
- **Misconceptions:** Spend more time on "opportunity cost = next best alternative" vs. "everything I give up." This confusion persists.
- **Technology:** Consider using online opportunity cost calculator/visualizer if available.
- **Connection to L-48:** Explicitly reference yesterday's lesson multiple times. Students don't always see connections automatically.
