### Activity 3: Price Elasticity and Purchase Timing (10 minutes)

**Objective:** Understand when prices are flexible (elastic) vs. sticky (inelastic), and use this to save money.

#### Part A: Elasticity Concept

**Price Elasticity of Demand:** How sensitive is quantity demanded to price changes?

**Elastic Demand** (price sensitive):
- Small price increase → Large decrease in quantity demanded
- Examples: Luxury goods, goods with many substitutes, non-essentials
- **Implication:** Sellers can't raise prices much without losing customers

**Inelastic Demand** (price insensitive):
- Price increase → Small decrease in quantity demanded
- Examples: Necessities, goods with few substitutes, addictive products
- **Implication:** Sellers can raise prices without losing many customers

**Why This Matters:**
- **Elastic goods:** Wait for sales, negotiate, find alternatives
- **Inelastic goods:** You have less leverage; focus on reducing consumption

#### Part B: Classify Goods and Plan Purchases (10 minutes)

**For each category, identify elasticity and strategy:**

| Purchase | Elastic or Inelastic? | Reasoning | Money-Saving Strategy |
|----------|----------------------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Gasoline** | Inelastic (short-term) | Need to get to work/school; few substitutes short-term | Reduce driving, carpool, buy fuel-efficient car long-term |
| **Concert tickets** | Elastic | Entertainment, many alternatives | Buy early, wait for resale market, attend less popular shows |
| **Prescription medication** | Inelastic | Medical necessity | Use generic, shop pharmacies, check insurance coverage |
| **Smartphone** | _____________ | | |
| **College textbooks** | _____________ | | |
| **Apartment rent in {{STATE_NAME}}** | _____________ | | |
| **Restaurant meals** | _____________ | | |
| **Winter coat** | _____________ | | |
| **Electricity** | _____________ | | |
| **Streaming services** | _____________ | | |

**Analysis:**

1. **Which of your regular expenses are most elastic?**
   - List: _______________________
   - Strategy: These are where you have the most negotiating power/flexibility

2. **Which expenses are inelastic?**
   - List: _______________________
   - Strategy: Reduce quantity consumed, find long-term substitutes

3. **Timing purchases of elastic goods:**
   - When is demand lowest? (Off-season, weekdays, end-of-month for cars, etc.)
   - Example: Winter coats are elastic → buy in spring when demand is low
   - Your example: _______________________

#### Part C: Real-World Application

**Your Major Purchase (from Opening Reflection):**

Purchase: _______________________

**Elasticity Analysis:**
- Is this good elastic or inelastic? _______________________
- How many substitutes exist? _______________________
- How urgently do you need it? _______________________

**Supply and Demand Analysis:**
- When is supply highest? _______________________
- When is demand lowest? _______________________
- Best time to buy: _______________________

**Price Negotiation Leverage:**
- If elastic + high supply + low demand → Strong leverage
- If inelastic + low supply + high demand → Weak leverage
- Your leverage: ☐ Strong ☐ Moderate ☐ Weak

**Action Plan:**
1. Optimal timing: _______________________
2. Negotiation strategy: _______________________
3. Alternatives if price too high: _______________________
4. Expected savings from good timing: $_______________________

### Connecting Concepts:

**From L-48 (Economic Systems):**
- Price mechanisms coordinate markets → Supply and demand IS the price mechanism in action
- {{STATE_NAME}}'s market economy → Most prices determined by supply and demand

**From L-49 (Scarcity and Opportunity Cost):**
- Scarcity creates markets → Limited supply drives prices up
- Opportunity costs → Supply curves show producers' opportunity costs; demand curves show consumers' willingness to pay

**From L-50 (Today):**
- Markets reach equilibrium → Self-adjusting through price signals
- Supply and demand shifts → Predict price changes and make better decisions
- Elasticity → Understand when you have leverage vs. when you don't
