## Opening: Why Do Prices Change?

**Quick Exercise:** Think about these questions:
- Why does gas cost more in summer than winter?
- Why does rent cost more in some {{STATE_NAME}} cities than others?
- Why did hand sanitizer prices spike during the pandemic?
- Why are airline tickets cheaper on Tuesdays?
- Why do roses cost triple on Valentine's Day?

**The Answer to All of These:** Supply and Demand

Today you'll understand the market forces that determine every price you pay—and how to use that knowledge for smarter financial decisions.

## Connecting to What You've Learned

**From L-48 (Economic Systems):**
- Market economies use **price mechanisms** to allocate scarce resources
- Prices coordinate decisions without a central planner
- {{STATE_NAME}}'s mixed economy relies heavily on market prices

**From L-49 (Scarcity and Opportunity Cost):**
- Scarcity means limited resources, unlimited wants
- **High prices signal high opportunity costs** (scarce resources)
- Low prices signal low opportunity costs (abundant resources)
- Incentives drive behavior

**Today's New Concept:**
Supply and demand curves show us **HOW** prices reach their levels and **WHY** they change. Understanding these forces helps you:
- Time purchases strategically
- Choose careers with strong demand
- Invest in assets whose prices will rise
- Avoid overpaying for goods and services

## The Law of Demand

**Law of Demand:** As price increases, quantity demanded decreases (and vice versa), all else being equal.

**Why?** Three reasons:

1. **Substitution Effect:** When prices rise, consumers switch to cheaper alternatives
   - Example: Beef prices rise → people buy more chicken
   - Example: {{STATE_NAME}} rent rises → people consider living further out or with roommates

2. **Income Effect:** Higher prices reduce your purchasing power
   - Example: Gas goes from $3 to $5/gallon → you have less money for other purchases
   - Your real income effectively decreased

3. **Diminishing Marginal Utility:** Each additional unit gives you less satisfaction
   - First slice of pizza: Amazing!
   - Fifth slice of pizza: Not so much
   - You'll only buy that fifth slice if the price is lower

### The Demand Curve

**Visual Representation:**
```
Price ($)
  ↑
  |
  |     ╲
  |       ╲  Demand Curve
  |         ╲
  |           ╲
  |_____________╲______→ Quantity
```

- **Downward sloping:** Higher price → lower quantity demanded
- **Each point** shows: "At this price, consumers will buy this quantity"
- **Movement ALONG the curve:** Price changes

### Example: Demand for Concert Tickets

| Price per Ticket | Quantity Demanded |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| $200 | 5,000 tickets |
| $150 | 10,000 tickets |
| $100 | 20,000 tickets |
| $50 | 40,000 tickets |

**Interpretation:**
- At $200, only die-hard fans buy (5,000)
- At $50, many more people can afford it (40,000)
- This is the **law of demand** in action

### Your Personal Demand Curve

Think about your demand for coffee:
- At $10/cup: Maybe once a month as a treat
- At $5/cup: A few times a week
- At $2/cup: Daily
- At $0.50/cup: Multiple times per day

**Key Insight:** You have a demand curve for everything you buy. Understanding YOUR price sensitivity helps you budget and find deals.

---

## The Law of Supply

**Law of Supply:** As price increases, quantity supplied increases (and vice versa), all else being equal.

**Why?** Sellers respond to incentives:

1. **Profit Motive:** Higher prices = higher profits → businesses produce more
   - Example: Housing prices rise in {{STATE_NAME}} → developers build more apartments

2. **New Entrants:** High prices attract new producers to the market
   - Example: High tech salaries → more people enter coding bootcamps

3. **Opportunity Cost:** Higher prices justify using more expensive production methods
   - Example: Oil at $100/barrel → profitable to drill in difficult locations
   - Oil at $30/barrel → only easy/cheap drilling is profitable

### The Supply Curve

**Visual Representation:**
```
Price ($)
  ↑         ╱
  |       ╱
  |     ╱  Supply Curve
  |   ╱
  | ╱
  |_______________→ Quantity
```

- **Upward sloping:** Higher price → higher quantity supplied
- **Each point** shows: "At this price, producers will supply this quantity"
- **Movement ALONG the curve:** Price changes

### Example: Supply of Apartments in {{STATE_NAME}}

| Rent per Month | Quantity Supplied |
|---------------|-------------------|
| $2,500 | 100,000 units |
| $2,000 | 80,000 units |
| $1,500 | 60,000 units |
| $1,000 | 40,000 units |

**Interpretation:**
- At $2,500/month, developers profit from building many units
- At $1,000/month, fewer units are profitable to build/maintain
- This is the **law of supply** in action

**Connection to L-49:** Remember opportunity cost? Landlords face opportunity costs:
- Rent apartment at $1,500/month OR
- Sell property and invest money elsewhere OR
- Use property for own purposes

Higher rent must exceed these opportunity costs to justify supplying apartments.

## Market Equilibrium: Where Supply Meets Demand

**Equilibrium:** The price where quantity demanded = quantity supplied

**At this price:**
- Every buyer who wants to buy can find a seller
- Every seller who wants to sell can find a buyer
- No shortages, no surpluses
- The market "clears"

### Example: Market for Used Cars

| Price | Quantity Demanded | Quantity Supplied |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| $30,000 | 100 | 400 | ← Surplus (300 cars)
| $25,000 | 200 | 300 | ← Surplus (100 cars)
| **$20,000** | **300** | **300** | ← **EQUILIBRIUM**
| $15,000 | 400 | 200 | ← Shortage (200 cars)
| $10,000 | 500 | 100 | ← Shortage (400 cars)

**Visual:**
```
Price ($)
  ↑         ╱
  |       ╱   Supply
  |     ╱ ╲
  |   ╱     ╲
  | ╱         ╲ Demand
  |_____________╲→ Quantity
      Equilibrium Point
```

**At $30,000 (above equilibrium):**
- Suppliers want to sell 400 cars
- Buyers only want 100 cars
- **Surplus of 300 cars**
- Sellers lower prices to sell excess inventory
- Price falls toward equilibrium

**At $10,000 (below equilibrium):**
- Buyers want 500 cars
- Sellers only supply 100 cars
- **Shortage of 400 cars**
- Buyers bid up prices to secure cars
- Price rises toward equilibrium

**Key Insight:** Markets naturally move toward equilibrium through the price mechanism (remember from L-48!). No central planner needed—prices coordinate millions of decisions.

## Shifts in Demand: Why the Whole Curve Moves

**Movement ALONG demand curve:** Price changes
**SHIFT in demand curve:** Something OTHER than price changes

### Factors That Shift Demand:

**1. Income Changes**
- Income rises → demand increases (curve shifts RIGHT)
- Income falls → demand decreases (curve shifts LEFT)
- Example: You get a raise → demand for restaurants increases

**2. Price of Related Goods**
- **Substitutes:** Goods that replace each other
  - Beef price rises → demand for chicken increases (shifts right)
  - Gas price rises → demand for electric cars increases
- **Complements:** Goods used together
  - Gas price rises → demand for SUVs decreases (shifts left)
  - Coffee price falls → demand for creamer increases

**3. Tastes and Preferences**
- Fashion changes → demand for certain clothing increases
- Health trends → demand for organic food increases
- Example: TikTok makes product viral → demand spikes

**4. Expectations About the Future**
- Expect prices to rise → buy now (demand increases)
- Expect recession → delay purchases (demand decreases)
- Example: Housing market hot → people rush to buy before prices rise more

**5. Number of Buyers**
- Population grows → demand increases
- Example: {{STATE_NAME}} population growing → demand for housing increases

### Example: Demand for Housing in {{STATE_NAME}}

**Scenario:** {{STATE_NAME}}'s economy is booming, attracting new residents and higher incomes.

**Effects:**
1. **Income increases** → Demand shifts RIGHT
2. **Population increases** (new residents) → Demand shifts RIGHT
3. **Expectations** (prices will keep rising) → Demand shifts RIGHT

**Result:**
- Original equilibrium: {{STATE_MEDIAN_HOME_PRICE}}
- New equilibrium: Higher price, higher quantity sold
- This is why {{STATE_NAME}} housing prices have risen in recent years

**Visual:**
```
Price
  ↑
  |        D₁ → D₂
  |      ╲    ╲
  |        ╲    ╲
  |          ╲    ╲
  |____________╲____╲→ Quantity
```

Demand shifts right → higher equilibrium price

**Personal Finance Application:**
If you're planning to buy a house in {{STATE_NAME}} and you see these factors (income growth, population growth), **prices will likely keep rising**. You might want to buy sooner rather than later.

## Shifts in Supply: Why Producers Change Behavior

**SHIFT in supply curve:** Changes in production costs or conditions

### Factors That Shift Supply:

**1. Input Costs**
- Costs fall → supply increases (curve shifts RIGHT)
- Costs rise → supply decreases (curve shifts LEFT)
- Example: Lumber prices fall → supply of new homes increases
- Example: {{STATE_NAME}} raises minimum wage → supply of restaurant meals may decrease (higher labor costs)

**2. Technology**
- Better technology → supply increases (can produce more efficiently)
- Example: Automation in manufacturing → supply increases
- Example: 3D printing → supply of custom products increases

**3. Number of Sellers**
- More sellers enter market → supply increases
- Sellers exit market → supply decreases
- Example: New apartments built in {{STATE_NAME}} → supply of rentals increases

**4. Expectations About the Future**
- Expect prices to rise → hold back supply now (supply decreases)
- Expect prices to fall → sell now (supply increases)
- Example: Oil producers expect higher future prices → pump less now

**5. Government Policies**
- Taxes → supply decreases (shifts left)
- Subsidies → supply increases (shifts right)
- Regulations → usually decrease supply (compliance costs)
- Example: {{STATE_NAME}} property tax increase → supply of rental housing might decrease

**6. Natural Events / External Shocks**
- Drought → supply of crops decreases
- Pandemic → supply chain disruptions decrease supply
- Good weather → bumper crop increases supply

### Example: Supply of Gasoline

**Scenario:** Oil refinery in {{STATE_NAME}} shuts down for maintenance.

**Effect:**
- Production capacity decreases → Supply shifts LEFT

**Result:**
- Original equilibrium: $3.50/gallon
- New equilibrium: $4.25/gallon (higher price, lower quantity)
- Shortage at old price → prices rise

**Visual:**
```
Price
  ↑     S₂ ← S₁
  |    ╱  ╱
  |  ╱  ╱
  |╱  ╱
  |__╱_______→ Quantity
```

Supply shifts left → higher equilibrium price, lower quantity

**Personal Finance Application:**
When you see supply disruptions (refinery shutdowns, shipping delays, factory closures), **expect prices to rise temporarily**. You might stock up before the disruption or wait for supply to recover.

## Putting It All Together: Market Analysis

### Pandemic Hand Sanitizer Example (Revisited from L-48)

**March 2020:**

**Step 1: Demand Shock**
- Pandemic hits → everyone wants hand sanitizer
- Demand shifts MASSIVELY RIGHT
- At old price ($3), huge shortage

**Step 2: Price Adjustment**
- Retailers raise prices to $12-15
- Shortage shrinks (some people buy less at higher price)
- Equilibrium moves along NEW demand curve

**Step 3: Supply Response**
- High prices signal profit opportunity
- Distilleries, breweries start making sanitizer (new entrants)
- Existing producers ramp up production
- Supply shifts RIGHT

**Step 4: New Equilibrium**
- Eventually supply catches up
- Prices fall back to $4-5
- Higher than before (demand still elevated) but much lower than peak

**Lessons:**
1. Prices signal scarcity and opportunity
2. High prices attract new supply
3. Markets self-correct (though it takes time)
4. Shortages occur when prices can't adjust (price controls)

### {{STATE_NAME}} Housing Market Analysis

**Current Situation:** {{STATE_MEDIAN_HOME_PRICE}}

**Demand Factors:**
- Population growth in {{STATE_NAME}}
- Rising incomes in {{STATE_MAJOR_INDUSTRIES}}
- Low mortgage rates (makes buying more affordable)
- **Result:** Demand shifts RIGHT

**Supply Factors:**
- Construction costs rising (lumber, labor)
- Zoning restrictions limit new building
- {{STATE_NAME}} regulations on development
- **Result:** Supply shifts LEFT or doesn't keep up with demand

**Outcome:**
- Equilibrium price rises significantly
- Shortage at old prices
- Bidding wars for homes

**What This Means for You:**
- If buying: Act quickly, expect competition, have financing ready
- If renting: Rent increases likely to continue
- If investing: Real estate in {{STATE_NAME}} may appreciate
- Career opportunity: Construction, real estate, property management in high demand

## Using Supply and Demand for Financial Decisions

### 1. Timing Purchases

**Strategy:** Buy when supply is high and demand is low; avoid buying when reversed.

**Examples:**
- **Cars:** Buy at end of model year (dealers need to clear inventory = high supply) or in winter (low demand)
- **Travel:** Fly on Tuesdays/Wednesdays (low demand) instead of weekends
- **Housing:** Buy in winter (fewer buyers = low demand) if possible
- **Clothing:** Buy off-season (winter coat in spring = low demand, high supply)

**Application to {{STATE_NAME}}:**
- When are homes cheapest in {{STATE_NAME}}? (Typically winter months)
- When is rent negotiable? (When vacancy rates are high = supply > demand)

### 2. Career Planning

**Strategy:** Choose careers where demand is rising and supply is limited.

**High Demand + Limited Supply = Rising Wages:**
- Healthcare in {{STATE_NAME}} (aging population = rising demand)
- Tech (digital transformation = rising demand)
- Skilled trades (plumbers, electricians = limited supply as workers age out)

**High Supply + Stagnant Demand = Stagnant Wages:**
- Oversaturated fields
- Industries being automated

**Research Question:** What careers in {{STATE_NAME}} have the best supply/demand outlook?

### 3. Investment Decisions

**Strategy:** Invest in assets where demand is likely to increase relative to supply.

**Examples:**
- Real estate in growing cities (demand ↑, supply limited by geography)
- Stocks in industries with rising demand (renewable energy, AI, healthcare)
- Collectibles with fixed supply and growing demand (art, rare items)

**Warning:** Speculation based on supply/demand is risky. Many factors affect prices.

### 4. Avoiding Overpaying

**Strategy:** Recognize when you're paying peak prices due to temporary demand spikes.

**Examples:**
- Valentine's Day roses (demand spike → 3× price)
- Christmas shopping in December (high demand)
- Summer gas prices (driving season = high demand)
- Concert tickets day-of-show (urgency = high willingness to pay)

**Smart Alternative:** Buy roses day before/after Valentine's, shop early for holidays, gas up before summer, buy concert tickets early.

## Discussion Questions

1. **Gas Prices in {{STATE_NAME}}:**
   - Gas prices are higher in summer than winter. Why?
   - Is this a demand shift or supply shift? (Demand shift right in summer—more driving)
   - How can you use this knowledge to save money?

2. **College Tuition:**
   - {{STATE_NAME}} public university tuition: {{STATE_TUITION_PUBLIC}}
   - Tuition has risen faster than inflation for decades. Why?
   - Demand analysis: More people attend college (demand ↑)
   - Supply analysis: Universities can't easily expand (limited supply)
   - Result: Price increases

3. **Labor Market:**
   - {{STATE_NAME}} unemployment rate: {{STATE_UNEMPLOYMENT_RATE}}
   - What does this tell you about supply and demand for workers?
   - Low unemployment = high demand for workers, limited supply → wages rise
   - How should this affect your wage negotiations?

4. **Rent in {{STATE_NAME}}:**
   - Median rent: {{STATE_MEDIAN_RENT}}/month
   - Why does rent vary so much between cities?
   - Supply: Geographic constraints, zoning, construction costs
   - Demand: Job opportunities, amenities, population growth
   - Where in {{STATE_NAME}} has the best rent-to-income ratio?

5. **Substitute Goods:**
   - As electric vehicles become cheaper, what happens to demand for gas cars?
   - As plant-based meat improves, what happens to demand for beef?
   - How can you profit from these trends (career, investments)?

## Connection to L-48 and L-49

**L-48 (Economic Systems):**
- Markets use **price mechanisms** to allocate resources → Supply and demand IS that price mechanism
- Competition creates incentives → Suppliers compete to meet demand
- {{STATE_NAME}}'s market economy → Supply and demand determine most prices

**L-49 (Scarcity and Opportunity Cost):**
- Scarcity drives economics → Supply curves represent opportunity costs of production
- High prices signal high opportunity costs → Demand curves represent willingness to pay based on opportunity costs
- Incentives drive behavior → Suppliers and consumers respond to price signals

**Key Integration:**
Supply and demand curves are visual representations of:
- Scarcity (limited supply)
- Opportunity cost (what we give up to buy/produce)
- Incentives (profit motive for suppliers, utility for consumers)
