## Detailed Facilitation Guide

### Opening Reflection (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Prime students to apply concepts to their personal decisions

**Facilitation Steps:**
1. Display prompt: "Think about a purchase you'll make in the next 6 months"
2. Set timer for 3 minutes silent writing
3. Questions on board:
   - "When is the best time to buy to get the lowest price?"
   - "What supply and demand factors affect the price?"
   - "How can you use market knowledge to save money?"
4. Transition: "Today you'll develop skills to analyze markets systematically. Keep your purchase in mind—we'll return to it."

**Do NOT:**
- Have students share publicly (purchases may be personal)
- Rush this reflection
- Judge their choices

**Monitoring:**
- Circulate to ensure students are engaged
- Note common purchases for later discussion examples

### Activity 1: {{STATE_NAME}} Housing Market Analysis (20 minutes)

**Objective:** Apply supply/demand framework to real {{STATE_NAME}} housing market

**Setup:**
Students work individually first, then discuss in groups of 3-4

**Facilitation Steps:**

**Introduction (2 minutes):**
1. "{{STATE_NAME}}'s median home price is {{STATE_MEDIAN_HOME_PRICE}}, median rent is {{STATE_MEDIAN_RENT}}/month"
2. "Why are prices at these levels? We're going to analyze supply and demand factors systematically"
3. "Then you'll use that analysis to make smart decisions about renting, buying, or investing"

**Part A: Individual Work - Identify Factors (5 minutes):**
1. "Complete the Demand Factors table"
2. "For each factor, decide: Does it increase or decrease demand? How strong is the effect?"
3. Set timer for 3 minutes
4. "Now complete Supply Factors table" (2 minutes)

**Circulate and Monitor:**
- Are students correctly identifying demand vs. supply factors?
- Common confusion: "Construction costs affect supply or demand?" (Supply—it's a cost of production)
- Are they considering {{STATE_NAME}}-specific factors?

**Expected Responses:**

**Demand Factors for Most States:**
- Population growth: Usually increasing demand (people moving in)
- Income levels: Rising incomes increase demand
- Mortgage rates: Low rates increase demand (cheaper to borrow)
- Employment: Strong job market increases demand

**Supply Factors:**
- Construction costs: Rising costs decrease supply (harder to profit)
- Land availability: Limited in urban areas = constrained supply
- Zoning: Restrictive zoning limits supply
- New builds: How many new units are being added?

**Key Teaching Point:**
"Notice: Demand is usually shifting right (people want to live in {{STATE_NAME}}), but supply often can't keep up. Result? Prices rise."

**Part B: Group Discussion - Predict Equilibrium (5 minutes):**
1. Arrange students in groups of 3-4
2. "Compare your analyses. Discuss:"
   - "Is demand shifting right or left overall?"
   - "Is supply shifting right or left?"
   - "What does this mean for prices?"
3. Set timer for 4 minutes
4. "Groups: Come to consensus on price prediction"

**Whole Class Debrief (3 minutes):**
1. "Quick poll: How many groups predict prices will rise?" (Show of hands)
2. "How many predict prices will fall?"
3. "How many predict stable prices?"
4. Call on 1-2 groups to share reasoning
5. **Teacher Input:** Share actual {{STATE_NAME}} trends and expert forecasts
   - "Current trend in {{STATE_NAME}}: [rising/falling/stable]"
   - "Your analysis should align with reality. If not, what did we miss?"

**Part C: Personal Application (5 minutes):**
1. "Now apply this to YOUR situation. Complete the three scenarios:"
   - Scenario 1: You're planning to rent
   - Scenario 2: You're planning to buy (in 5-10 years)
   - Scenario 3: You're considering real estate investment

2. Set timer for 5 minutes
3. Students work individually

**Circulate and Coach:**
- Are students connecting market analysis to personal decisions?
- Help struggling students: "If prices are rising and you plan to buy in 5 years, what should you do?" (Save aggressively, consider buying sooner if possible)
- Advanced students: "Calculate required down payment and monthly savings needed"

**Key Insights to Highlight:**
- **If renting:** "In hot markets, sign longer leases to lock in rent. In cooling markets, go month-to-month or shorter lease"
- **If buying:** "Rising prices mean urgency. Falling prices mean patience. Know which market you're in."
- **If investing:** "Real estate investment depends on rental demand, appreciation, and cash flow. Analyze all three."

**Differentiation:**
- **Struggling students:** Provide partially completed tables with some factors identified
- **Advanced students:** "Research: Compare {{STATE_NAME}} to neighboring states. Where has better housing market outlook?"
- **Fast finishers:** "Calculate break-even point: When does buying become cheaper than renting in {{STATE_NAME}}?"

### Activity 2: {{STATE_NAME}} Labor Market Analysis (15 minutes)

**Objective:** Use supply/demand to make career decisions

**Facilitation Steps:**

**Introduction (2 minutes):**
1. "Labor market works like any other market:"
   - "You supply your labor"
   - "Employers demand workers"
   - "Wage is the price that clears the market"
2. "High demand + limited supply = rising wages (good career bet)"
3. "Oversupply + weak demand = stagnant wages (risky career)"

**Part A: Research Career Fields (8 minutes):**
1. "Choose 3 career fields that interest you"
2. "For each, research:"
   - "Demand factors: Is industry growing? Why?"
   - "Supply factors: How many people entering field? Competition?"
   - "Starting salary in {{STATE_NAME}}"
   - "10-year salary projection"
3. "Resources: BLS website, {{STATE_NAME}} Dept of Labor, industry reports"
4. Set timer for 7 minutes

**Facilitate Research:**
- Have key websites bookmarked and ready
- Point students to Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Outlook
- {{STATE_NAME}} Department of Labor wage data
- Help students interpret data: "Job growth of 15% means demand is increasing"

**Examples to Share:**
- **Software Engineer:** High demand (digital transformation), increasing supply (bootcamps, CS degrees), but demand > supply still → wages rising
- **Physical Therapist:** High demand (aging population), limited supply (need doctorate), low unemployment → strong wages
- **Retail Worker:** Moderate demand, high supply (low barriers to entry), automation threat → wage pressure

**Circulate and Assist:**
- "How do you know if demand is increasing?" (Job growth projections, hiring trends, news about industry)
- "What signals limited supply?" (High education requirements, licensing, specialized skills)

**Part B: Partner Comparison and Strategy (5 minutes):**
1. "Partner up. Share your three careers."
2. "Discuss:"
   - "Which has the best supply/demand outlook?"
   - "What skills can you develop to reduce 'supply of you' (make yourself scarce)?"
   - "What industries in {{STATE_NAME}} align with your interests?"
3. "Complete your personal strategy"

**Whole Class Insights (2 minutes):**
1. "What careers came up as having strong demand in {{STATE_NAME}}?"
2. Create list on board (expect: healthcare, tech, skilled trades)
3. "What careers face challenges?" (Manufacturing automation, retail transformation)
4. **Key Teaching Point:** "Don't just follow passion. Understand the market. Best careers = your interests + strong market demand."

**Scenario Analysis (if time permits):**
- Briefly discuss three scenarios from student content (AI revolution, {{STATE_NAME}} boom, remote work)
- Ask: "How would each scenario change your career choice?"

**Differentiation:**
- **Struggling students:** Provide pre-selected careers to research rather than open choice
- **Advanced students:** "Create 10-year income model comparing your three careers, including opportunity costs"
- **ELL students:** Pair with partner for research assistance

### Activity 3: Price Elasticity and Purchase Timing (10 minutes)

**Objective:** Understand when prices are flexible vs. sticky; use this to save money

**Facilitation Steps:**

**Introduction (2 minutes):**
1. **Define Elasticity:** "Price elasticity of demand = how sensitive is quantity demanded to price changes?"
2. **Elastic** (price sensitive):
   - "Examples: Concert tickets, restaurant meals, luxury goods"
   - "You have negotiating power; wait for sales"
3. **Inelastic** (price insensitive):
   - "Examples: Gasoline (short-term), prescription meds, utilities"
   - "You have little leverage; focus on reducing consumption"

**Visual:**
Draw two demand curves on board:
- Elastic: Flat (horizontal-ish) - small price change = big quantity change
- Inelastic: Steep (vertical-ish) - big price change = small quantity change

**Part A: Classify Goods (4 minutes):**
1. "Complete the elasticity table"
2. "For each purchase, identify:"
   - "Elastic or inelastic?"
   - "Why?"
   - "Money-saving strategy?"
3. Set timer for 4 minutes

**Circulate and Coach:**
- Are students correctly classifying?
- Common confusion: "Gasoline is inelastic short-term (you need it for work) but elastic long-term (you can buy efficient car, move closer to work)"
- Help students develop strategies

**Expected Classifications:**

| Purchase | Elasticity | Strategy |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Concert tickets | Elastic | Buy early or wait for resale; attend less popular shows |
| Gasoline | Inelastic (short-term) | Reduce driving, carpool, fuel-efficient car long-term |
| Prescription meds | Inelastic | Use generics, shop pharmacies, insurance |
| Smartphones | Elastic | Buy last year's model, wait for sales, consider refurbished |
| Textbooks | Elastic (alternatives exist) | Buy used, rent, digital, library |
| Rent ({{STATE_NAME}}) | Moderate | Negotiate, consider roommates, look in less competitive areas |

**Part B: Class Discussion (2 minutes):**
1. "Which of your regular expenses are most elastic?" (Students share)
2. "Those are where you have leverage. Shop around, negotiate, time purchases."
3. "Which are inelastic?" (Students share)
4. "For those, reduce quantity consumed or find long-term substitutes."

**Part C: Apply to Opening Reflection Purchase (2 minutes):**
1. "Remember your purchase from the opening? Revisit it now."
2. "Complete your analysis:"
   - Elasticity
   - Supply and demand factors
   - Optimal timing
   - Expected savings
3. Students work individually

**Key Teaching Point:**
"Understanding elasticity is like having a superpower in negotiations. You know when you have leverage (elastic goods, high supply, low demand) and when you don't (inelastic goods, low supply, high demand). Use this knowledge strategically."

**Differentiation:**
- **Struggling students:** Provide examples with classifications; students focus on strategies
- **Advanced students:** "Calculate: If demand is elastic and price drops 10%, quantity demanded increases 30%. What's the elasticity coefficient?" (3.0 - elastic)

### Activity 4: Market Analyzer Tool - Skill Builder (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Synthesize learning with practical analysis tool

**Facilitation Steps:**

**Introduction (1 minute):**
1. "Final activity: Use the Market Analyzer framework to analyze any market you choose"
2. "This is your tool for future financial decisions—use it before major purchases, career moves, investments"

**Independent Work (4 minutes):**
1. Students choose a market from the list (housing, labor, consumer electronics, cars, other)
2. "Complete the 6-step analysis"
3. Set timer for 4 minutes

**Circulate and Monitor:**
- Are students applying concepts correctly?
- Are they making realistic predictions?
- Are their personal decisions aligned with their analysis?

**No Whole-Class Sharing:**
- These are individual decisions
- Students submit completed analyzer as assessment

**Assessment Opportunity:**
Collect Market Analyzer submissions for grading

**Rubric:**
- Correctly identified demand factors (25%)
- Correctly identified supply factors (25%)
- Reasonable equilibrium prediction (20%)
- Aligned personal decision with analysis (20%)
- Monitoring plan identified (10%)

**Extension for Fast Finishers:**
"Create a second Market Analyzer for a different market. Compare predictions."

## Lesson Wrap-Up (included in Activity 4 time)

**Key Takeaways:**
1. "Supply and demand analysis isn't abstract—it helps you make better decisions about housing, careers, and purchases"
2. "{{STATE_NAME}} markets have specific supply/demand factors you should understand"
3. "Elasticity tells you when you have negotiating leverage"
4. "Market timing can save thousands of dollars over time"

**Preview Next Chapter:**
"Tomorrow: L-51 - Market Structures and Consumer Choice. We've assumed competitive markets so far. But what if there's only one seller (monopoly)? Or a few big sellers (oligopoly)? How does market structure change your strategies as a consumer?"

## Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1: Students struggle to find reliable labor market data**
- **Solution:** Have pre-selected websites bookmarked. Provide {{STATE_NAME}} Dept of Labor handouts with key data.

**Challenge 2: Housing market analysis reveals depressing affordability crisis**
- **Solution:** Acknowledge reality but focus on actionable strategies: "Yes, housing is expensive in {{STATE_NAME}}. That's why understanding the market matters—so you can plan accordingly (roommates, different locations, building income, etc.)"

**Challenge 3: Activities run long due to research time**
- **Solution:** Provide data sheets to reduce research time. Or assign Activity 2 research as homework before class.

**Challenge 4: Students make unrealistic predictions**
- **Solution:** That's okay—it's practice! During circulation, ask: "What evidence supports that prediction?" Help refine reasoning.

**Challenge 5: Wide variation in completion pace**
- **Solution:** Have extension questions ready. Allow fast finishers to start on homework or research additional markets.

## Connection to Day 1 Concepts

Continuously reference yesterday:
- "Remember the demand shifters from yesterday? We're applying them to {{STATE_NAME}} housing."
- "Yesterday we learned about equilibrium. Today you're predicting future equilibrium based on shifts."
- "Elasticity builds on the demand curve concept. It's about the steepness of the curve."

---

## Notes for Next Year

- **Activity 1 timing:** Housing analysis is engaging but time-consuming. Students need full 20 minutes.
- **Data currency:** Update {{STATE_NAME}} housing and labor data before each school year
- **Research scaffolding:** Consider providing more specific data sources or pre-research summaries to save time
- **Elasticity:** This concept can be abstract. Use more concrete examples (students' own purchases)
- **Technology:** If computer lab available, use interactive graphing tools for supply/demand
- **Local context:** Invite guest speaker (realtor, career counselor, economist) to discuss {{STATE_NAME}} markets

## Reflection Questions for Teachers

After teaching this lesson:
1. Did students successfully apply supply/demand framework to real markets?
2. Were housing and labor market analyses realistic and well-reasoned?
3. Did students understand elasticity concept?
4. How well did {{STATE_NAME}}-specific content resonate?
5. What timing adjustments are needed?
6. Which students need additional support in market analysis skills?
7. Did students make connections between market analysis and personal financial decisions?

## Tomorrow's Preparation

**L-51: Market Structures and Consumer Choice**

Preview for yourself:
- Market structures (perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, monopoly)
- How structure affects prices and consumer surplus
- {{STATE_NAME}} examples of each structure
- Consumer strategies in different structures

Be ready to reference back:
- "L-50 assumed competitive markets. But what if competition is limited?"
- "Supply and demand still matter, but market power changes outcomes"
- "Understanding market structure helps you recognize when you're getting fair prices"

Students should be able to identify market structures in their daily lives and adjust consumption strategies accordingly.
