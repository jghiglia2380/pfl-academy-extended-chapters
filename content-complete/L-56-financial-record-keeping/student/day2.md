## Learning Lab Activities

### Activity 1: Statement Reconciliation Challenge (15 minutes)

**Objective:** Practice the complete reconciliation process with a realistic monthly scenario

**Instructions:**
You'll receive:
- A complete month of transaction history (25-30 transactions)
- A bank statement for the same month
- A partially completed checkbook register

**Your Task:**
1. Complete the checkbook register by adding missing transactions:
   - Three debit card purchases not yet recorded
   - One ATM withdrawal
   - Two automatic payments (subscription services)
   - One direct deposit (paycheck)

2. Calculate the running balance after each transaction

3. Mark which transactions have cleared (appear on the bank statement)

4. Identify outstanding transactions (in your register but not on the statement)

5. Complete the reconciliation process:
   - Start with the statement's ending balance: $_______
   - Add deposits not yet credited: $_______
   - Subtract outstanding checks/payments: $_______
   - Result should match your register balance: $_______

6. If balances don't match, systematically identify the discrepancy:
   - Check for math errors in your calculations
   - Look for missing or duplicate transactions
   - Verify all amounts are correct (no transposed numbers)
   - Identify any bank fees or interest not recorded

**Success Criteria:**
- All transactions correctly recorded in register
- Running balance accurately calculated
- Reconciliation completed with matching balances
- Any discrepancies identified and explained

**Digital Tool:** Use the Checkbook Reconciliation Simulator's "Monthly Challenge" mode for an interactive version with immediate feedback.

### Activity 2: Error Detection Workshop (12 minutes)

**Objective:** Develop the ability to quickly identify common financial record-keeping errors

**Instructions:**
You'll analyze four different checkbook registers, each containing specific types of errors commonly made in real-world financial tracking.

**Scenario A - The Math Mistake:**
- Register shows a balance of $427.85
- Bank statement shows $392.85
- All transactions are recorded and cleared
- **Find the error:** One running balance calculation is incorrect

**Scenario B - The Missing Transaction:**
- Register balance: $856.30
- Bank statement balance: $821.30
- **Find the error:** One bank fee of $35 is on the statement but not in the register

**Scenario C - The Duplicate Entry:**
- Register balance: $234.50
- Bank statement balance: $289.50
- **Find the error:** One $55 debit card purchase was accidentally recorded twice

**Scenario D - The Timing Issue:**
- Register balance: $614.25
- Bank statement balance: $489.25
- **Find the error:** A $125 check written on the last day of the month hasn't cleared yet (outstanding)

**Your Task for Each Scenario:**
1. Identify the type of error (math, missing, duplicate, or timing)
2. Calculate the corrected balance
3. Explain how to prevent this error in the future
4. Time yourself—can you find all four errors in under 10 minutes?

**Extension Challenge:**
Create a scenario with a combination error (two different mistakes in one register) and trade with a partner to solve.

### Activity 3: Fraud Alert Simulation (10 minutes)

**Objective:** Practice identifying unauthorized transactions and responding appropriately

**Instructions:**
You're reviewing your account activity and notice some suspicious transactions. Your task is to determine which are fraudulent and what actions to take.

**Your Transaction List (Past 7 Days):**
1. Starbucks, $6.47 - Recognized ✓
2. Amazon.com, $34.99 - Recognized ✓
3. Shell Gas Station, $42.00 - Recognized ✓
4. "Premium Services LLC", $2.99 - **Unrecognized** ⚠️
5. Grocery Store, $67.23 - Recognized ✓
6. "Digital Subscriptions Inc.", $4.95 - **Unrecognized** ⚠️
7. Netflix, $15.49 - Recognized ✓
8. Fast Food, $11.85 - Recognized ✓
9. "Tech Solutions Pro", $9.99 - **Unrecognized** ⚠️
10. Pharmacy, $28.45 - Recognized ✓

**Fraud Detection Protocol:**
1. **Identify** potentially fraudulent charges (marked above)
   - What pattern do you notice in the suspicious charges?
   - Why might criminals start with small amounts?

2. **Document** the suspicious activity:
   - Record the dates, amounts, and merchant names
   - Note when you first discovered the issue
   - Gather receipts or records proving the charges aren't yours

3. **Report** following the proper procedure:
   - Contact bank's fraud department immediately (24/7 hotline)
   - Dispute the unauthorized charges
   - Request a new debit card
   - Set up fraud alerts on your account

4. **Prevent** future fraud:
   - Review where your card information might have been compromised
   - Update payment methods on legitimate accounts
   - Monitor your account daily for several weeks
   - Consider credit monitoring services

**Discussion Questions:**
- Why do fraudsters often make small "test charges" before larger fraudulent purchases?
- What's the maximum liability for unauthorized debit card charges if reported within 2 days? Within 60 days?
- How does regular account reconciliation help protect against fraud?

**Digital Tool:** Use the Fraud Alert Simulator to practice identifying patterns of fraudulent activity across multiple scenarios.

### Activity 4: Financial Tracking System Design (13 minutes)

**Objective:** Create a personalized financial record-keeping system that fits your lifestyle and needs

**Instructions:**
Design and set up your own comprehensive financial tracking system by working through the following components:

**Part 1: Choose Your Method (3 minutes)**
Evaluate three tracking approaches and select the one best suited to your habits:

**Option A - Traditional Checkbook Register:**
- Pros: Portable, no technology needed, forces intentional recording
- Cons: Requires discipline, manual calculations, can be lost
- Best for: People who prefer tangible records, minimal transactions

**Option B - Spreadsheet System:**
- Pros: Automatic calculations, easy categorization, customizable, backup capability
- Cons: Requires computer/device access, setup time
- Best for: People comfortable with technology, wanting detailed analysis

Based on your chosen method, complete the initial setup:

**If Traditional Register:**
- Record your current account balance
- Set up transaction categories (create 8-10 relevant categories)
- Practice recording 5 sample transactions with running balance
- Create a reconciliation schedule (weekly or monthly)

**If Spreadsheet:**
- Download and customize the Transaction Tracker template
- Enter your starting balance

- Customize your dashboard for most important information

**Part 3: Establish Habits (3 minutes)**
Create your personal record-keeping routine:
- **Daily habit:** When will you record transactions? (Immediately after purchase? End of day?)
- **Weekly review:** What day/time will you reconcile and review spending?
- **Monthly check-in:** When will you review categories, adjust budgets, and evaluate goals?
- **Backup plan:** How will you ensure records aren't lost? (Cloud storage? Regular exports?)

**Deliverable:**
Complete the Financial Organization Planner with:
- Your chosen tracking method and rationale
- Initial system setup (screenshot or photo of first entries)
- Your habit commitment schedule
- Plan for regular reconciliation and review

### Activity 5: Real-World Scenario Resolution (10 minutes)

**Objective:** Apply record-keeping skills to solve realistic financial challenges

**Instructions:**
You'll work through three progressively complex scenarios that require financial record-keeping skills to resolve.

**Scenario 1 - The Mysterious Overdraft (Complexity: Low)**
Sarah checked her account Monday morning and saw a balance of -$47.82 with a $35 overdraft fee. She's confused because she thought she had over $200.

**Her Recent Activity:**
- Previous balance: $284.50
- Friday: Dinner $43.20
- Saturday: Groceries $78.45, Movies $32.00
- Sunday: Gas $38.50
- Monday: Rent check cleared $1,100 (written 2 weeks ago, she forgot it hadn't cleared yet)

**Your Task:**
- Create a checkbook register showing all transactions
- Calculate the running balance after each transaction
- Explain what caused the overdraft
- Describe how Sarah could have prevented this

**Scenario 2 - The Disputed Charge (Complexity: Medium)**
Marcus notices a $127.50 charge from "ABC Electronics" on his statement. He doesn't remember making this purchase and suspects fraud. However, his partner reminds him he ordered a birthday gift online three weeks ago.

**Your Task:**
- List the steps Marcus should take to verify if this is legitimate or fraudulent
- What documentation should he gather?
- If it's legitimate but he doesn't recognize the merchant name, how can he confirm?
- If it's fraud, what's his action plan?
- How would proper record-keeping (saving receipts, logging online purchases) have prevented this confusion?

**Scenario 3 - The Tax Preparation Crisis (Complexity: High)**
Jamie, a freelance photographer, needs to file taxes but has incomplete records for the year. She has:
- Bank statements (available online)
- Some receipts (maybe 60% of expenses)
- Vague memory of business-related purchases

**Her Deductible Expense Categories Should Include:**
- Camera equipment and supplies
- Software subscriptions
- Website hosting
- Travel to photo shoots
- Home office expenses
- Professional development

**Your Task:**
- Design a system Jamie can use RIGHT NOW to organize the records she has
- Create a plan for reconstructing missing expense documentation
- Outline a record-keeping system for next year to prevent this problem
- Calculate the potential tax impact of missing deductions (assume 25% tax rate on $5,000 in undocumented expenses)

**Discussion:**
Share your solutions with a partner. Did you approach the problems differently? What strategies were most effective?
