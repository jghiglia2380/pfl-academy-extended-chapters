# L-46: Automobile Finance - Buying vs. Leasing - Teacher Guide (Day 1)

## Lesson Overview
This lesson introduces students to the financial complexities of vehicle acquisition, emphasizing that monthly payment affordability is only one component of total cost of ownership. Students will analyze buying versus leasing, understand depreciation, and learn to make vehicle financing decisions aligned with their broader financial goals. The lesson combinesfinancial literacy concepts with practical decision-making frameworks students will use throughout their lives.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Differentiate between buying and leasing vehicles, including financial trade-offs
- Calculate total cost of ownership including often-overlooked expenses
- Analyze how depreciation affects vehicle value and financing decisions
- Evaluate different loan terms and their impact on total interest paid
- Apply state-specific cost factors (taxes, fees, insurance) to vehicle decisions
- Make informed vehicle financing choices aligned with personal financial circumstances

## Detailed Lesson Plan

### Hook & Introduction (5 minutes)
**Opening Scenario:**
"A student walks into a dealership, sees a car with payments of $399/month, and thinks 'I can afford that—I make $2,500/month!' Six months later, they're struggling financially. What happened?"

**Facilitation:**
- Write $399/month on the board prominently
- Ask students: "Is this affordable for someone making $2,500/month?"
- Record initial responses
- Reveal the hidden costs:
  - Insurance: +$200/month
  - Fuel: +$150/month
  - Maintenance: +$50/month
  - **Total: $799/month (32% of income)**
- Introduce the lesson premise: Vehicle acquisition is one of the most significant financial decisions, yet many people focus only on monthly payment
- Preview learning outcomes: Today we learn to see the complete financial picture

### Key Concepts (10 minutes)
**Delivery Method:** Direct instruction with visual aids

**Core Vocabulary:**
1. **Auto Loan** (secured financing)
   - Explain collateral concept
   - Typical terms: 36-72 months
   - Interest rates vary by credit score
   - **STATE NOTE**: Current average rate in {{STATE_NAME}}: {{STATE_AVG_AUTO_LOAN_RATE_NEW}}% for new cars, {{STATE_AVG_AUTO_LOAN_RATE_USED}}% for used

2. **Lease** (rental agreement with purchase option)
   - Not ownership, but right to use
   - Lower monthly payments but no equity
   - Mileage and condition restrictions
   - **STATE NOTE**: Typical lease acquisition fees in {{STATE_NAME}}: ${{STATE_LEASE_ACQUISITION_FEE}}

3. **Depreciation**
   - Visual: Show depreciation curve (new car loses 20-30% year 1, 60% by year 5)
   - Example: $30,000 car → $21,000 year 1 → $12,000 year 5
   - Why it matters: Affects equity, resale value, GAP insurance needs

4. **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**
   - Purchase/lease payments
   - Insurance (**STATE SPECIFIC**: [Your state average for 18-25 year olds: $___/month])
   - Fuel
   - Maintenance & repairs
   - Registration (**STATE SPECIFIC**: [Initial: $___, Annual: $___])
   - Sales tax (**STATE SPECIFIC**: [Your state rate: ___%])
   - Depreciation/residual value

5. **Opportunity Cost**
   - Money spent on a car can't be invested elsewhere
   - Example: $500/month car payment vs. $500/month invested at 7% for 30 years = $600,000

**Check for Understanding:**
- Quick quiz: "True or False: A lease means you own the car." (False)
- Calculation: "If a $25,000 car depreciates 25% in year 1, what's it worth?" ($18,750)
- Application: "Why might a longer loan term result in being 'underwater'?"

### Buy vs. Lease Comparison (15 minutes)
**Activity Structure:** Guided comparison with student participation

**Setup:**
Create a visual comparison chart on board/screen:

| Factor | BUYING | LEASING |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Monthly payment | Higher | Lower |
| Ownership | Yes (after payoff) | No |
| Mileage limits | None | 10k-15k/year |
| Customization | Yes | No |
| End result | Own asset | Return car |
| Long-term cost | Lower (if kept) | Higher (perpetual payments) |

**Facilitation:**
1. Present a specific vehicle: 2024 Toyota Camry, $28,000 MSRP

2. **Buy Scenario:**
   - $5,600 down (20%)
   - $22,400 financed at 6% for 60 months
   - Monthly payment: $433
   - Total paid: $31,580 over 5 years
   - Value at year 5: ~$11,000
   - **Net cost**: $20,580
   - **Plus STATE fees**: Sales tax [___% = $___], Registration [Initial $___, Annual 5x$___]

3. **Lease Scenario:**
   - $2,000 down
   - $350/month for 36 months
   - Total paid: $14,600 over 3 years
   - At year 3: Return car or buy at residual value (~$16,500)
   - **If you lease again**: Another $2,000 down + $350/mo × 24 months = $10,400
   - **Total 5-year cost**: $25,000 with no asset
   - **Plus STATE fees**: Acquisition fee [$___], Disposition fee [$___]

4. **Class Discussion:**
   - Under what circumstances might leasing make sense? (Business use, always want new car, can't afford down payment)
   - When is buying clearly better? (Long-term ownership, high mileage, want to build equity)
   - What role does personal situation play? (Income stability, credit score, lifestyle)

**Differentiation:**
- **Advanced**: Calculate break-even point (when does total buying cost = total leasing cost?)
- **Support**: Provide pre-filled calculator with scenarios to compare
- **Extension**: Research actual local dealership offers and compare to our examples

### Total Cost of Ownership Deep Dive (10 minutes)
**Objective:** Students understand all costs beyond the payment

**Activity:** Build a complete 6-year cost breakdown together

**Example Vehicle:** Used 2021 Honda Civic, $22,000 purchase price

**Costs to Calculate:**
1. **Purchase & Financing:**
   - Down payment: $2,200
   - Loan: $19,800 at 7% for 48 months = $475/month
   - Total payments: $22,800
   - Interest paid: $3,000

2. **STATE-SPECIFIC Fees (Year 1):**
   - Sales tax: [___% of $22,000 = $___]
   - Title & registration: [$___]
   - **Total upfront**: $___

3. **Recurring Annual Costs:**
   - Registration renewal: [${{STATE_REGISTRATION_ANNUAL}}/year in {{STATE_NAME}}]
   - Insurance: [${{STATE_INSURANCE_AVG_TEEN}} average for age group × 6 years]
   - Fuel: [15,000 miles/year ÷ 32 mpg × $3.50/gal × 6 years = $___]
   - Maintenance: [$700/year × 6 years = $4,200]
   - Repairs: [$1,500 over 6 years (used car)]

4. **Residual Value:**
   - 2021 Civic value in 2030: ~$8,000

5. **TOTAL 6-YEAR COST:**
   - Add all costs above
   - Subtract residual value
   - **Net cost**: $___
   - **Cost per mile**: Net cost ÷ 90,000 miles = $___/mile

**Class Participation:**
- Have students calculate each component
- Compare to their assumptions at lesson start
- Discuss: "What surprised you about the total cost?"

**KEY INSIGHT:** Even after paying off the loan, you still have years of ownership costs (insurance, fuel, maintenance), but NO monthly payment, which is where long-term value comes from.

### Real-World Examples (10 minutes)
**Format:** Analyze three contrasting approaches

**Mia's Buy-and-Keep Strategy:**
- Read scenario together
- Identify key decisions: Bought used, financed reasonably, kept car after payoff
- Calculate her benefit: Saved $342/month × 36 months = $12,312
- Discuss: How did her patience pay off?

**James's Perpetual Lease Cycle:**
- Read scenario together
- Identify the problem: Always has a payment, never builds equity
- Calculate his loss: $42,864 spent, $0 value received
- Discuss: What opportunity cost did he incur?

**Taylor's Strategic Balance:**
- Read scenario together
- Identify the sweet spot: New car benefits + long-term ownership savings
- Calculate her success: Lower total cost + payment-free years + investing savings
- Discuss: How can you apply Taylor's strategy?

**Facilitation Notes:**
- Emphasize that James isn't "wrong"—he valued always having a new car—but he paid dearly for it
- Connect to personal values: What do YOU value? Lowest cost? Newest features? Flexibility?
- Link to broader financial goals: How does your vehicle decision affect saving for a home, retirement, etc.?

### Skill Builder Introduction (5 minutes)
**Launch:** Auto Finance Decision Calculator

**Instructions:**
1. Explain the tool's purpose: Compare real scenarios with complete financial data
2. Demonstrate one quick example input
3. Show the output: Monthly payments, total costs, equity over time, decision points
4. Assign the activity:
   - Research one vehicle you're interested in
   - Create 3 scenarios: Buy new, buy used, lease
   - Input **STATE-SPECIFIC** data (use provided reference sheet)
   - Compare results and document findings
5. Preview Day 2: We'll do hands-on analysis with multiple scenarios
6. Homework: Complete skill builder and bring findings to next class

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Struggling Students
- Provide pre-filled calculator with sample data
- Use simplified examples with round numbers
- Focus on monthly payment vs. total cost comparison only
- Pair with peer mentor for calculations

### For Advanced Students
- Calculate opportunity costs of different scenarios
- Research actual local dealership offers and analyze
- Compare new vs. used car depreciation curves
- Explore business lease tax advantages

### For ELL Students
- Provide vocabulary handout with images
- Use visual comparison charts heavily
- Offer bilingual resources where available
- Allow use of translation tools

### For Students with Limited Transportation Experience
- Explain why people need cars (geography-dependent)
- Discuss alternative transportation options
- Focus on decision-making framework over car enthusiasm
- Connect to other major purchases (housing, education)

## Common Misconceptions

**Misconception 1:** "If I can afford the monthly payment, I can afford the car."
- **Correction:** Total cost includes insurance, fuel, maintenance, registration, etc. that can double your monthly expense

**Misconception 2:** "Leasing is always a bad deal."
- **Correction:** Leasing can make sense for certain situations (business use, very short-term needs, always wanting newest features), but it's more expensive long-term for typical personal use

**Misconception 3:** "A longer loan term is better because the payment is lower."
- **Correction:** Longer terms mean more interest paid and higher risk of being underwater. It's only "better" if you invest the payment difference wisely.

**Misconception 4:** "New cars are always better investments."
- **Correction:** New cars depreciate fastest. Used cars (2-3 years old) offer best value, having already absorbed steepest depreciation.

**Misconception 5:** "I'll just get GAP insurance so being underwater doesn't matter."
- **Correction:** GAP insurance costs money and only helps if the car is totaled. It doesn't solve the problem of owing more than the car is worth.

## Assessment Opportunities

**Formative Assessment:**
- Exit ticket: "List three costs of owning a vehicle beyond the monthly payment"
- Partner quiz: Students quiz each other on buy vs. lease characteristics
- Calculator check: Review skill builder inputs for accuracy

**Summative Assessment (Day 2):**
- Complete scenario analysis in Learning Lab
- Vehicle Financing Decision Matrix with personal strategy
- Reflection on how vehicle financing fits into broader financial planning

## Extension Activities

**For Early Finishers:**
1. Research electric vehicle incentives in {{STATE_NAME}}
2. Calculate total cost of EV vs. gas vehicle over 8 years
3. Explore how credit score affects interest rates (use rate examples)
4. Interview family member about their vehicle financing experience

**For Homework:**
- Find three vehicle financing offers online
- Calculate true cost using TCO formula
- Identify hidden fees or costs not mentioned in ads
- Write reflection on findings

## Resources & Materials

**Required:**
- Auto Finance Decision Calculator (digital platform)
- Comparison chart template
- State-specific cost reference sheet
- Example loan amortization schedule

**Optional:**
- Guest speaker from local credit union
- Sample vehicle loan documents
- Kelly Blue Book or similar valuation tool access
- Insurance quote comparison tool

**STATE-SPECIFIC Resources:**
- {{STATE_NAME}} DMV fee schedule: {{STATE_DMV_URL}}
- {{STATE_NAME}} average insurance costs by age: ${{STATE_INSURANCE_AVG_TEEN}}/month for young drivers
- {{STATE_NAME}} sales tax and registration: {{STATE_SALES_TAX}}% tax, ${{STATE_REGISTRATION_INITIAL}} initial, ${{STATE_REGISTRATION_ANNUAL}} annual
- Local dealership financing offers (3-4 examples)

## Instructor Support Notes

**Time Management:**
- If running long, shorten real-world examples to 5 minutes (read only one scenario)
- If running short, extend buy vs. lease comparison with student questions

**Common Questions:**
- **"Should I always buy used?"** Not always, but it usually provides best value. New cars offer warranty and latest features at a premium.
- **"Is a 72-month loan okay?"** Only if you plan to keep the car 10+ years and can't afford a shorter term. You'll pay significantly more interest.
- **"What about 0% financing offers?"** These are real, but often require excellent credit and you may give up other incentives/discounts.
