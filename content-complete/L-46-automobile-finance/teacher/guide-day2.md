# L-46: Automobile Finance - Buying vs. Leasing - Teacher Guide (Day 2 - Learning Lab)

## Learning Lab Overview
Day 2 transitions from conceptual understanding to hands-on application. Students use real market data and financial calculators to analyze vehicle financing scenarios, ultimately creating a personalized decision framework they'll use when acquiring their own vehicles. This session is 90% activity-based with minimal direct instruction—your role is facilitator, coach, and troubleshooter.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this Learning Lab, students will be able to:
- Calculate complete total cost of ownership for specific vehicles
- Use financial calculators to compare buying versus leasing scenarios
- Analyze how loan terms affect monthly payments and total interest
- Apply state-specific cost factors to real-world vehicle decisions
- Create a personalized vehicle financing strategy aligned with their financial goals
- Evaluate trade-offs between monthly affordability and total cost

## Detailed Facilitation Guide

### Lab Setup & Objectives (5 minutes)

**Opening:**
"Yesterday we learned the concepts. Today we become vehicle financing analysts. You'll work with real vehicles, real prices, and real state costs to make informed decisions. By the end, you'll have a personal framework for when YOU buy or lease a car."

**Instructions:**
1. Form working groups/pairs
2. Ensure calculator access
3. Distribute state cost reference sheets
4. Review the activity sequence
5. Set expectations:
   - This is hands-on learning—you'll make mistakes and learn from them
   - Use real data, not guesses
   - Document your findings—you'll use this later
   - Ask questions as you work

**Quick Check:**
- "What's one key difference between buying and leasing?" (Gauge retention from Day 1)
- "What costs beyond the monthly payment must we consider?" (Activate prior knowledge)

### Activity 1: Real-World Vehicle Cost Breakdown (15 minutes)

**Objective:** Students calculate TRUE total cost using state-specific factors

**Setup:**
- Divide class into groups of 3-4
- Assign one vehicle profile to each group:
  - **Profile A**: 2024 Honda Civic ($28,000 new)
  - **Profile B**: 2021 Toyota RAV4 ($24,000 used)
  - **Profile C**: 2024 Hyundai Elantra (lease: $299/month, 36 months)

**Facilitation Steps:**

**1. Input Gathering (5 minutes)**
- Groups research/use provided data for their vehicle
- Guide them to input STATE-SPECIFIC factors:
  - **Sales tax**: "In {{STATE_NAME}}, vehicles are taxed at {{STATE_SALES_TAX}}%"
  - **Registration**: "Initial ${{STATE_REGISTRATION_INITIAL}}, Annual ${{STATE_REGISTRATION_ANNUAL}}"
  - **Insurance**: "For drivers your age in {{STATE_NAME}}, typical monthly premium is ${{STATE_INSURANCE_AVG_TEEN}}"
  - **Fuel**: "Calculate: annual miles ÷ EPA mpg × current gas price in {{STATE_NAME}} (${{STATE_GAS_PRICE_CURRENT}}/gallon)"

**2. Calculation Phase (7 minutes)**
- Groups use Total Cost Calculator
- Circulate and assist:
  - **Common error**: Forgetting to multiply annual costs × 6 years
  - **Help prompt**: "Did you include ALL six years of registration renewals?"
  - **Check**: Ensure they're calculating residual value correctly

**3. Presentation & Comparison (3 minutes)**
- Each group shares: "Our vehicle costs $___/year or $___/mile"
- Create comparison chart on board
- Facilitate discussion:
  - Which profile has lowest total cost? Why?
  - How much do state-specific fees add?
  - What surprised you?

**Differentiation:**
- **Struggling groups**: Provide partially filled calculator to focus on key concepts
- **Advanced groups**: "Now add a major repair at year 4 ($2,000). How does that change your analysis?"
- **Early finishers**: "Calculate cost-per-mile if you drove 20,000 miles/year instead of 15,000"

**Monitoring Points:**
- Are students using actual state costs or guessing?
- Do they understand why Profile C (lease) has different cost structure?
- Are calculations reasonable? (Red flag: Total costs below purchase price)

### Activity 2: Buy vs. Lease Decision Simulator (20 minutes)

**Objective:** Comprehensive comparison using students' vehicle of choice

**Setup:**
- Individual or pair work
- Each student selects ONE vehicle they're genuinely interested in
- Access to internet for current pricing research

**Facilitation Steps:**

**1. Vehicle Research (5 minutes)**
- Students find their vehicle on automotive websites
- Record:
  - New price (MSRP)
  - Used price (3 years old, similar mileage)
  - Current lease offers (if available)
- **Coach**: "Look at multiple sources—prices vary significantly"
- **Redirect**: Students choosing luxury vehicles → "Let's keep it realistic for typical budgets"

**2. Scenario Building (12 minutes)**
- Students create three scenarios in Auto Finance Decision Calculator:

**Scenario 1: Buy New**
- Guide them: "20% down is typical, but some buyers put down less"
- "Check current interest rates on bankrate.com or credit union sites"
- **STATE INPUT**: "Don't forget {{STATE_NAME}} sales tax ({{STATE_SALES_TAX}}%) and registration fees (Initial ${{STATE_REGISTRATION_INITIAL}}, Annual ${{STATE_REGISTRATION_ANNUAL}})"

**Scenario 2: Buy Used (3 years old)**
- "Find the 3-year-old version of your vehicle—it's usually 30-40% cheaper"
- "Used car rates are typically 1-2% higher. Why?" (More risk for lender)
- "Insurance is usually lower on used cars"

**Scenario 3: Lease New**
- "Research actual lease offers for your vehicle"
- **STATE COSTS**: "Add acquisition fee (typically ${{STATE_LEASE_ACQUISITION_FEE}} in {{STATE_NAME}})"
- "Remember: You'll have a disposition fee when you return it"

**3. "What-If" Analysis (3 minutes)**
- Encourage exploration:
  - "What if you drive 18,000 miles/year in the lease?" (Add overage charges)
  - "What if you keep the purchased car for 10 years?" (Add 4 more years of costs, but no payments)
  - "What if interest rates go up 2%?" (Recalculate scenarios)

**Circulate & Coach:**
- **Common mistake**: Using MSRP instead of negotiated price ("Dealers rarely get full MSRP—knock 5-10% off")
- **Depth question**: "Now look at year 4 on your amortization schedule. Are you underwater on the loan?"
- **Connection**: "How does this align with your budget from other chapters?"

**Documentation Checkpoint:**
- Students should have complete data for all three scenarios
- Check that they're recording findings (they'll need this for Activity 4)

**Time Management:**
If running long, limit to 2 scenarios (Buy Used + one other)

---

### Activity 3: Loan Terms Impact Analysis (15 minutes)

**Objective:** Understand the interest/flexibility trade-off

**Setup:**
- Pairs or individual
- Use Loan Terms Analyzer tool
- Standard vehicle scenario: $26,000 financed

**Facilitation Steps:**

**1. Setup & Introduction (2 minutes)**
- "You've chosen your vehicle. Now: How do you finance it?"
- Present the scenario: $26,000 loan at current {{STATE_NAME}} average rates ({{STATE_AVG_AUTO_LOAN_RATE_NEW}}%)
- "We're comparing three loan terms. What do you predict will happen to monthly payments? Total interest?"

**2. Calculation Phase (8 minutes)**
Students compare:
- 36 months at 5.5% APR
- 60 months at 6.0% APR
- 72 months at 7.5% APR

**Guided Questions (circulate and ask):**
- "How much do you save per month with the 72-month loan vs. 36-month?"
- "But how much more interest do you pay total?"
- "At what point in each loan are you 'underwater'? Check the amortization schedule."
- "If you had to sell at year 3, which option is best?"

**3. Opportunity Cost Integration (3 minutes)**
- "The 72-month loan saves you $394/month vs. 36-month loan"
- "Pull up the Opportunity Cost Calculator"
- "If you invested that $394/month for 6 years at 7% return, what would you have?" ($34,785)
- **Discussion**: "So is the longer loan 'saving' you money or costing you opportunity?"

**4. Personal Application (2 minutes)**
- "Given your budget, which loan term would YOU choose?"
- "What would you do with the monthly payment difference?"
  - Pay down debt?
  - Build emergency fund?
  - Invest?
  - Spend on other things?

**Key Teaching Moment:**
Many students will gravitate toward the longest loan because of lower monthly payments. Challenge them: "This FEELS affordable, but what's the hidden cost?" (Total interest + opportunity cost)

**Differentiation:**
- **Support**: Provide completed calculation examples, focus discussion on "which is better for you?"
- **Advanced**: "Calculate the 'true cost' including opportunity cost of investable difference"
- **Extension**: "Research how credit scores affect rates—calculate scenarios with 3%, 7%, and 12% rates"

### Activity 4: Personal Vehicle Financing Strategy (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Synthesize learning into actionable personal framework

**Format:** Individual reflection + Decision Matrix completion

**Instructions:**
1. "Based on everything you've analyzed, complete the Vehicle Financing Decision Matrix"
2. "This isn't about the 'right' answer—it's about what's right for YOU"

**Matrix Components:**
- **Your Priorities** (rank 1-5): Lowest payment, lowest total cost, new vehicle, no eventual payment, flexibility
- **Your Circumstances**: Income, savings, mileage, career stability, credit
- **State Factors**: Insurance costs, taxes, registration
- **Recommended Approach**: Buy new / Buy used / Lease
- **Personal Rules**: Your financing boundaries

**Facilitation:**
- Circulate and ask clarifying questions:
  - "Why did you rank 'newest vehicle' as your top priority?"
  - "How does your career stability affect this decision?"
  - "What's your plan for after the loan is paid off?"

**Validation:**
- Check that students' recommended approach aligns with their stated priorities
- **Example red flag**: Top priority is "lowest total cost" but recommends leasing (disconnect)
- **Coach through**: "I notice you want the lowest cost but chose leasing. Let's look at your analysis again..."

**Time Management:**
If running short, make this homework and move to debrief

---

### Debrief & Takeaways (5 minutes)

**Whole-Class Discussion:**

**1. Key Insights (2 minutes)**
- "What's ONE thing that surprised you today?"
- Record responses on board—look for themes:
  - How much state fees add up
  - The power of keeping a car after payoff
  - How much interest matters on longer loans
  - Opportunity cost of vehicle spending

**2. Action Commitments (2 minutes)**
- "When you're ready to buy/lease a vehicle, what will you do differently because of today?"
- Have 3-5 students share

**3. Connections (1 minute)**
- "How does this connect to other financial goals we've discussed?"
  - Emergency fund (what if car breaks down?)
  - Retirement (opportunity cost of payments vs. investing)
  - Housing (debt-to-income ratios for mortgages)
  - Credit (payment history affects credit score)

**Final Thought:**
"Your vehicle is probably the second-largest purchase you'll make after housing. The decisions you make—buy vs. lease, new vs. used, loan terms—can mean a difference of tens of thousands of dollars over your lifetime. You now have the tools to make informed decisions. Use them."

## Assessment & Monitoring

### Formative Assessment Throughout:
- **Activity 1**: Check calculations for reasonableness
- **Activity 2**: Verify students are using state-specific costs
- **Activity 3**: Ensure understanding of interest/term relationship
- **Activity 4**: Validate alignment between priorities and decisions

### Summative Assessment Options:
1. **Portfolio Review**: Collect Decision Matrix + scenario analyses for completeness and reasoning
2. **Reflection Essay**: "What vehicle financing approach makes sense for you in 3 years and why?"
3. **Presentation**: Students present their vehicle choice and financing rationale to class

### Red Flags to Address:
- Student using luxury vehicle far beyond realistic budget
- Calculations that don't include state-specific costs
- Choosing longest loan term without considering opportunity cost
- Not factoring in total ownership costs beyond payment

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Struggling Students:
- Provide pre-loaded calculator scenarios (they just need to adjust a few variables)
- Focus on one comparison: Buy used vs. lease
- Pair with strong peer
- Simplify Decision Matrix to 3 key priorities

### For Advanced Students:
- Add complexity: EV vs. gas vehicle total cost over 10 years
- Calculate tax implications of business vehicle use
- Research and present on {{STATE_NAME}}'s vehicle incentive programs
- Create an opportunity cost analysis: Car payment vs. investment growth over 30 years

### For Diverse Learners:
- **ELL**: Provide glossary, allow translation tools, use heavy visual aids
- **Students without vehicle access**: Frame as "when you have career income" or focus on decision framework
- **Students from low-income backgrounds**: Emphasize used vehicle value, avoid luxury examples, discuss alternative transportation

## Troubleshooting Guide

**Problem**: "I can't find my vehicle's lease offers online"
- **Solution**: Use one of the provided sample scenarios or choose a different vehicle

**Problem**: "The calculator says I'd be underwater for 4 years!"
- **Solution**: "That's the lesson! Longer loans and low down payments create this risk. How could you avoid it?"

**Problem**: "This vehicle is too expensive for any of my scenarios"
- **Solution**: "Great realization! That's exactly what this analysis is for. Let's find a vehicle that fits your budget."

**Problem**: Students are getting wildly different results
- **Solution**: Verify they're all using same state costs. Create standardization sheet on board.

**Problem**: Running out of time
- **Priorities**: Complete Activities 1 and 2 fully. Activity 3 can be homework. Activity 4 is quick.

## State-Specific Teaching Notes

**HIGH PRIORITY - Before teaching, research:**

**Your State's Unique Factors:**
- □ Sales tax rate and any exemptions
- □ Registration fee structure (flat or value-based?)
- □ Annual renewal costs
- □ Insurance requirements and typical costs
- □ Emissions or safety inspection requirements
- □ Any first-time buyer programs
- □ EV/hybrid incentives or rebates

**Local Market Conditions:**
- □ Average loan rates at local credit unions
- □ Typical dealer incentives in your region
- □ Insurance rate variations by county (urban vs. rural)
- □ Gas price variations

**Resources for Students:**
- {{STATE_NAME}} DMV website: {{STATE_DMV_URL}}
- {{STATE_NAME}} insurance comparison: {{STATE_INSURANCE_COMPARISON_URL}}
- Local credit union rate sheets
- Consumer reports for reliability data

**Teaching Tip:**
Bring in real examples from your local market. Students engage better with "the Honda dealership on Route 50" than generic examples.

## Extension & Enrichment

**For Early Finishers:**
1. Research {{STATE_NAME}}'s lemon laws and consumer protections
2. Calculate insurance differences between comprehensive and liability-only coverage
3. Create a presentation: "Best vehicles for new drivers in {{STATE_NAME}}"
4. Interview a family member about their best/worst vehicle purchase

**Homework Options:**
1. Find three vehicle financing offers online and analyze using today's framework
2. Calculate total cost of ownership for your family's current vehicle
3. Write a reflection: "How will I approach vehicle financing differently because of this lesson?"
