# L-65 Teacher Guide: Investment Portfolio Diversification - Day 2 Learning Lab

## Learning Lab Overview
Today's session transforms yesterday's portfolio diversification concepts into hands-on portfolio construction and analysis skills. Students work through four activity stations where they analyze asset correlations, design age-appropriate allocations, survive market crisis simulations, and practice rebalancing discipline. The format is highly interactive—approximately 50 minutes of hands-on work with digital tools and realistic scenarios. Your role shifts from instructor to facilitator, circulating among students to guide discovery, answer questions, and ensure productive engagement.

## Learning Objectives
- Analyze how diversification reduces portfolio risk through correlation principles
- Construct balanced investment portfolios using appropriate asset allocation strategies
- Evaluate the relationship between portfolio diversification and expected returns
- Apply rebalancing strategies to maintain target allocation over time
- Design age-appropriate investment portfolios aligned with time horizon and risk tolerance

## Detailed Facilitation Guide

### Setup & Introduction (5 minutes)
**0:00-0:05**

**Your Role:** Set expectations; ensure tool access; quick review.

**Script:**
"Yesterday we learned WHY diversification reduces risk—combining assets with low correlation smooths returns. Today you'll BUILD diversified portfolios, see how they perform through crashes, and practice the discipline of rebalancing. This is 90% you working, 10% me coaching."

**Quick Review (2 minutes):**
- "What does correlation measure?" (How closely two investments move together)
- "Why do we rebalance?" (Maintain target allocation, force buy low/sell high)
- "Why should young investors have more stocks than older investors?" (Time to recover from crashes)

**Tool Access Check (2 minutes):**
Ensure everyone can access the Correlation Matrix Analyzer.

**Transition:** "Let's start by seeing which assets actually move together and which don't."

---

### Activity 1: Correlation Detective Challenge (13 minutes)
**0:05-0:18**

**Your Role: Guide Discovery & Question Answerer**

**What to Look For:**
- Are students reading correlation values correctly? (+1.0 = perfect correlation, -1.0 = perfect inverse)
- Do they understand why low correlation creates diversification benefits?
- Are they making strategic portfolio choices or random ones?

**Common Questions and Coaching Responses:**

**"What does +0.7 correlation mean?"**
- **Coaching:** "Pretty high correlation—they move together most of the time, but not perfectly. Some diversification benefit, but not dramatic."

**"Why do US stocks and bonds have negative correlation?"**
- **Coaching:** "During crises, investors sell stocks (prices fall) and buy bonds for safety (prices rise). They tend to move opposite during stressful times."

**"Which assets should I combine for maximum diversification?"**
- **Coaching:** "Look for pairs with correlation closest to zero or negative. Stocks and bonds? Gold and stocks? Real estate and bonds?"

**Key Teaching Points to Reinforce:**

When you see students discovering correlations, reinforce:
- **High correlation (+0.7 to +1.0):** "If US stocks and international stocks both have +0.8 correlation, combining them helps a little but not dramatically."
- **Low/zero correlation (-0.2 to +0.2):** "Stocks and gold near zero? Perfect! They move independently—one can rise while other falls."
- **Negative correlation (-0.3 to -1.0):** "US stocks and bonds at -0.2? Great diversification! When stocks crash, bonds often rise."

**Portfolio Comparison Phase:**

When students build the three test portfolios (100% stocks, 50/50 stocks/bonds, multi-asset), watch for discovery moments:

**Discovery: "The 50/50 portfolio lost way less during crashes!"**
- **You:** "Exactly! What was max drawdown for 100% stocks vs. 50/50?" (Might be -42% vs. -22%)
- "That's the power of low correlation. Bonds didn't crash with stocks."

**Discovery: "But the 100% stock portfolio had higher returns overall."**
- **You:** "Yes! That's the tradeoff. More risk = more return. The question is: Can you handle -42% loss without panic selling? If not, 50/50 might be better despite lower returns."

**Circulate and Identify:**
Look for students who find the "optimal" multi-asset portfolio balancing risk and return. Ask them to share with class.

**Transition:** "You've seen how correlation works. Now let's design allocations for real investors at different ages."

### Activity 2: Age-Based Allocation Strategy Builder (15 minutes)
**0:18-0:33**

**Your Role: Coach & Reality Checker**

**This is the longest activity—it requires careful thinking about three different investors.**

**Circulation Strategy:**
Move continuously. Students will need guidance on "appropriate" allocations.

**For Each Investor Profile:**

**Maya (Age 25):**

**What to Look For:**
- Students should recommend aggressive allocation (80-95% stocks)
- Common mistake: being too conservative because $400/month seems small

**If student builds 60/40 for Maya:**
- **Coaching:** "Maya is 25 with 40 years to retirement. Why conservative? Show her what happens. Run the simulation with 60/40 vs. 90/10. How much wealth difference at age 65?"
- The tool might show $1.2M (60/40) vs. $1.8M (90/10)—a $600K opportunity cost for being too conservative

**Good allocation for Maya:** 85-90% stocks, 10-15% bonds

**David (Age 45):**

**What to Look For:**
- Moderate allocation (65-80% stocks) is appropriate
- Students should balance growth need with increasing risk sensitivity

**If student builds 90/10 for David:**
- **Coaching:** "David has 22 years to retirement, not 40. If a crash happens at age 60, does he have time to recover before needing the money? What's his max drawdown?"

**If student builds 40/60 for David:**
- **Coaching:** "Too conservative? David still needs growth—he's not retiring for 22 years. Compare wealth outcomes for 40/60 vs. 70/30."

**Good allocation for David:** 65-75% stocks, 25-35% bonds

**Patricia (Age 60):**

**What to Look For:**
- Conservative allocation (35-45% stocks) to protect accumulated wealth
- Students should prioritize capital preservation over growth

**If student builds 70/30 for Patricia:**
- **Coaching:** "Patricia retires in 7 years. If stocks crash 40% when she's 65, she might have to delay retirement. What's her max drawdown with 70% stocks?" (Could be -28% or worse)
- "Try 40/60—less growth, but much less crash risk."

**Good allocation for Patricia:** 35-45% stocks, 55-65% bonds

**Key Discussions to Facilitate:**

**When students finish all three:**
- "Notice the pattern? As age increases, stock allocation decreases. Why does this make sense?"
- "What's the biggest risk for young investors?" (Being too conservative, missing growth)
- "What's the biggest risk for near-retirees?" (Crash right before retirement, can't recover)

**Common Powerful Realization:**
Student: "Whoa! Using 40/60 for David instead of 70/30 costs him $300,000 by retirement!"

- **You:** "Yes! That's the opportunity cost of being too conservative when you still have 20+ years. Time is your friend."

**Transition:** "You've designed allocations. Now let's see how they perform when markets crash."

### Activity 3: Market Crisis Survival Simulation (14 minutes)
**0:33-0:47**

**Your Role: Emotional Coach & Decision Guide**

**This activity has the most emotional impact—students experience simulated crashes.**

**What to Look For:**
- How do students react emotionally to watching portfolio values drop?
- Do they make panic decisions or stay disciplined?
- Do they understand rebalancing's value during crises?

**During Portfolio Building (5 minutes):**

**Portfolio A (Concentrated):**
Watch what students choose:
- If they pick 100% stocks: "Good test case. You'll see max drawdown."
- If they pick 100% one sector (all tech): "Even riskier—sector crashes can be 60-70% losses."

**Portfolio B (Diversified):**
Check that students actually diversify:
- Should have at least 3 asset classes
- Bonds should be meaningful percentage (20-40%)

**If poorly diversified:**
- **Coaching:** "You have 60% US large-cap, 30% US small-cap, 10% international. That's not really diversified—all stocks, all correlated. Add bonds or other assets."

**During Crisis Simulation (6 minutes):**

This is where emotional teaching happens.

**Month 9 Decision Point** (Crisis Peak):

Many students will panic. Watch for:
- "I want to sell everything!" responses
- Uncertainty about whether to rebalance

**If student wants to panic sell:**
- **DON'T immediately say it's wrong.** Let them make the decision and see the consequence.
- After simulation: "You sold at the bottom and locked in a 40% loss. Look what happened next—recovery to new highs. What did you miss?"
- **Teaching moment:** "This is why crashes destroy wealth—not the crash itself, but emotional decisions."

**If student rebalances (sells bonds, buys stocks):**
- **Affirm:** "That felt wrong, didn't it? Buying stocks when they're crashing? But look—you bought low. Watch what happens in recovery."
- After simulation: "Your rebalancing meant you recovered faster and ended with MORE wealth than just holding."

**Comparing Outcomes (3 minutes):**

Facilitate discovery:
- "Who had Portfolio A (concentrated)? What was your max loss?" (Might be -50%)
- "Who had Portfolio B (diversified)? Your max loss?" (Might be -22%)
- "Same market crash—why such different outcomes?" (Low correlation between assets)

**Most Important Question:**
"Who could emotionally handle a 50% loss without panic selling?"
- Most hands down
- "That's why diversification matters—not preventing losses, but keeping them survivable."

**Powerful Student Revelation:**
Student: "My diversified portfolio didn't gain as much in the bull market, but it lost way less in the crash and recovered faster!"

- **You:** "Exactly! Diversification sacrifices some upside for much better downside protection. Smoother path to same destination."

**Transition:** "One more skill—rebalancing discipline."

### Activity 4: Rebalancing Practice Lab (8 minutes)
**0:47-0:55**

**Your Role: Discipline Coach**

**This activity teaches the hardest skill—taking action that feels wrong.**

**What to Look For:**
- Do students rebalance consistently or make emotional decisions?
- Do they understand they're selling winners and buying losers?

**Key Decision Years:**

**Year 3 (Stocks Have Surged):**
Portfolio is now 78% stocks (target 70%)

**If student doesn't rebalance:**
- **Coaching:** "You're now taking more risk than you planned. If a crash hits year 4, you'll lose more than expected."

**If student rebalances:**
- **Affirm:** "You're selling stocks after they tripled. Feels like selling winners, right? But you're locking in gains and managing risk."

**Year 7 (Stocks Have Crashed):**
Portfolio is now 58% stocks (target 70%)

**If student doesn't rebalance:**
- **Coaching:** "You're now more conservative than you intended. If stocks recover, you'll miss some gains."

**If student rebalances:**
- **Affirm:** "You're buying stocks after they crashed 35%. That's scary! But you're buying low—exactly what you want."

**Final Comparison (Last 2 minutes):**

Show three outcomes:
1. **Student's decisions**
2. **Always rebalance** (systematic discipline)
3. **Never rebalance** (let it drift)

**Common Result:**
"Always rebalance" ends with best risk-adjusted returns and stays on target allocation.

**Discussion:**
- "Did annual rebalancing help or hurt?" (Usually helps by reducing risk and often improving returns)
- "Was it emotionally harder to rebalance after surges or after crashes?" (Most say after crashes—buying what just fell)
- "What's your commitment? Annual? When drift exceeds 5%?" (Students set personal rule)

**Teaching Point:**
"Rebalancing is emotional discipline made mechanical. Set the rule, follow it, don't overthink."

## Reflection & Wrap-up (5 minutes)
**0:55-0:55**

**Time is very tight—2-3 minutes max for discussion.**

**Quick Questions (pick 1-2):**
1. "What surprised you most about correlation and diversification?"
2. "After the crisis simulation, would you invest differently than before this class?"
3. "What allocation strategy will you use at your first job?"

**Final Message (30 seconds):**
"Diversification, age-appropriate allocation, and disciplined rebalancing are how successful investors build wealth. Not picking hot stocks. Not timing markets. Just systematic strategy executed patiently over decades. You now have the tools."

## Assessment & Monitoring

### Formative Assessment During Activities

**Activity 1:** Check correlation matrix interpretations; verify portfolio construction logic
**Activity 2:** Ensure allocations are age-appropriate; verify understanding of risk-time relationship
**Activity 3:** Observe emotional reactions and decision-making during crisis
**Activity 4:** Monitor rebalancing discipline and understanding of purpose

### Red Flags to Address

**Red Flag: Student making all random/arbitrary decisions**
- **Intervention:** "Walk me through why you chose 45% stocks for the 25-year-old. What's your reasoning?"

**Red Flag: Student frozen/overwhelmed**
- **Intervention:** Sit with them briefly, simplify: "Just focus on two asset classes—stocks and bonds. What percentage of each?"

**Red Flag: Student disengaged or off-task**
- **Intervention:** "What's challenging about this? How can I help make it click?"

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Advanced Students
- Challenge: Find the mathematically optimal portfolio (efficient frontier)
- Analyze how international diversification further reduces risk
- Calculate actual rebalancing trades in dollars, not just percentages
- Research target-date funds and critique their glide paths

### For Struggling Students
- Simplify to 2-3 asset classes maximum (stocks, bonds, cash)
- Provide example allocations for each age group as starting points
- Focus on one simulation (skip complex multi-asset portfolios)
- Use "120 minus age" rule for quick allocation decisions

### For English Language Learners
- Visual aids for allocation (pie charts color-coded)
- Pre-teach vocabulary: correlation, allocation, rebalance, drawdown
- Allow translation tools during activities
- Pair with English-proficient partners

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Technology Issues

**Problem: Tool won't load or is very slow**
- **Solution:** Have paper worksheets showing sample correlation matrices, allocation tables, and rebalancing scenarios

**Problem: Crisis simulation freezes**
- **Solution:** Describe verbally what would happen; use historical market data charts as backup

**Problem: Too many students accessing simultaneously**
- **Solution:** Stagger activities; half class starts with Activity 1 while other half does Activity 2

### Engagement Issues

**Problem: Students rushing through without analysis**
- **Solution:** Require written answers to reflection questions before moving to next activity

**Problem: "This won't apply to me, I won't have money to invest"**
- **Solution:** "Your first job will offer 401(k). You'll need these skills within 5 years. And if you receive graduation gifts, inheritance, or save from early jobs, this helps you invest it wisely."

## Teacher Reflection

After teaching, consider:
1. Which activity generated the most engagement and learning?
2. Did the crisis simulation create the emotional impact intended?
3. Were students able to handle the mathematical aspects (percentages, allocation calculations)?
4. How effectively did the tools work? Any technical issues?
5. Did students connect this to their actual future investing needs?
6. What would you adjust about timing or activity sequence?
