# L-65 Teacher Guide: Investment Portfolio Diversification - Day 1

## Lesson Overview
This lesson introduces students to the foundational principles of portfolio diversification, explaining how spreading investments across uncorrelated assets reduces risk without sacrificing returns. Students learn Modern Portfolio Theory concepts, understand correlation patterns between asset classes, explore age-based allocation strategies, and practice rebalancing principles. The Portfolio Diversification Builder skill builder provides hands-on experience constructing portfolios and observing how different allocation strategies perform under various market conditions. This is advanced investing content requiring mathematical thinking and long-term perspective.

## Learning Objectives
- Analyze how diversification reduces portfolio risk through correlation principles
- Construct balanced investment portfolios using appropriate asset allocation strategies
- Evaluate the relationship between portfolio diversification and expected returns
- Apply rebalancing strategies to maintain target asset allocation over time
- Design age-appropriate investment portfolios aligned with time horizon and risk tolerance

## Preparation

### Materials Needed
- Student content (L-65 Day 1 text)
- Portfolio Diversification Builder (digital tool) - test access before class
- Calculator access for students (for percentage and growth calculations)
- Whiteboard/projector for displaying correlation matrices and allocation charts
- Optional: Historical market data charts showing different asset classes over time

### Pre-Class Setup
1. Ensure all students can access the Portfolio Diversification Builder
2. Review the three real-world examples and prepare discussion questions
3. Have visual aids ready: correlation matrix example, allocation pie charts for different ages
4. Prepare simple correlation demonstration (two stocks that move together vs. oppositely)
5. Consider whether students will work individually or in pairs on the Skill Builder
6. Have current market data available if students ask about recent performance

### Facilitation Notes
This chapter deals with concepts that may feel abstract or distant for high school students who aren't yet investing. Make it concrete by connecting to decisions they'll face within 5-10 years (first job 401(k) choices, using inheritance money wisely, deciding whether to invest graduation gifts). Some students may have families who lost significant wealth in market crashes and are skeptical of investing entirely—acknowledge this fear while explaining how diversification specifically addresses crash risk. This is mathematically intensive content (correlation coefficients, percentages, growth calculations)—provide calculator support and focus on conceptual understanding over perfect numerical precision.

## Detailed Lesson Plan

### Introduction & Hook (5 minutes)
**0:00-0:05**

**Activity:** Present two investor scenarios:

"Two friends, both 25 years old, each receive $50,000 from a grandparent. Sarah invests all $50,000 in one technology company stock she's excited about. Jordan splits the $50,000 across a stock index fund ($35,000), a bond fund ($12,500), and an international stock fund ($2,500). Over the next three years:

- Sarah's stock surges 200% to $150,000, then crashes 70% to $45,000. She panics and sells, locking in a $5,000 loss.
- Jordan's portfolio steadily grows to $68,000 despite a market crash (stocks fell 35%, bonds rose 6%, international stocks fell 25%). Jordan stays invested because the crash was manageable, not catastrophic.

Who made the better decision? Why?"

**Facilitation:**
- Many students will initially say Sarah made the better decision because she reached $150,000
- Point out the psychological reality: Sarah experienced euphoria followed by panic, leading to a permanent loss
- Jordan's steadier path, while less exciting, actually resulted in more wealth and sustainable confidence
- **Key message**: "Diversification isn't about getting rich quick—it's about building wealth reliably without catastrophic losses that force panic mistakes."

**Transition:** "Today we're learning the mathematical and practical principles that separate gambling from strategic investing."

### Key Concepts Review (10 minutes)
**0:05-0:15**

**Activity:** Review the 10 key concepts with participatory approach.

**Critical Concepts to Emphasize:**

**Correlation:**
- This is THE fundamental concept that makes diversification work
- Use visual demonstration: Draw two line graphs on board
  - Graph A: Two lines moving perfectly together (correlation +1.0)
  - Graph B: Two lines moving opposite (correlation -1.0)
  - Graph C: Two lines moving independently (correlation near 0)
- "When you combine investments with low correlation, their ups and downs partially cancel out, reducing overall volatility."

**Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT):**
- Nobel Prize-winning framework proving diversification mathematically
- Key insight: It's not about picking 'safe' investments—it's about picking investments that move differently from each other
- "You can combine two volatile investments and create a less volatile portfolio if they have low correlation."

**Systematic vs. Unsystematic Risk:**
- **Unsystematic risk**: Company-specific (CEO resigns, product fails, lawsuit). Diversification eliminates 70-80% of this.
- **Systematic risk**: Market-wide (recession, interest rates, war). Affects everything; can't be diversified away.
- "No matter how diversified you are, you still experience market-wide ups and downs. But you avoid company-specific disasters."

**Asset Allocation:**
- This determines 90% of your portfolio's behavior
- "Choosing whether to be 70% stocks vs. 40% stocks matters WAY more than whether you own Microsoft or Apple."
- Show visual: Pie charts of aggressive (90% stocks), moderate (60% stocks), conservative (40% stocks) allocations

**Rebalancing:**
- The discipline that enforces "buy low, sell high" automatically
- Work through quick example:
  - Start: $7,000 stocks, $3,000 bonds (70/30)
  - After growth: $10,000 stocks, $3,200 bonds (76/24)
  - Rebalance: Sell $663 stocks, buy $663 bonds → Back to 70/30
- "You're selling what just surged and buying what lagged. Feels wrong but forces discipline."

**Check for Understanding:**
- Quick quiz: "Two stocks have correlation of +0.9. What does this mean?" (They move almost identically; little diversification benefit)
- "Stocks and bonds have correlation near -0.2. What does this mean?" (They move somewhat independently or opposite; good diversification)

**Transition:** "Now let's explore the mathematics of why this works and how to apply it."

---

### Deeper Exploration (15 minutes)
**0:15-0:30**

This section covers five major topics. Manage time carefully.

#### Part 1: Mathematics of Diversification (3 minutes)
**0:15-0:18**

**Facilitation:**
Don't let students get lost in math—focus on the intuitive insight.

**Live Example:**
"You have $10,000. Two options:
- **Option A:** All in Tech Stock X. Could gain 30% or lose 40%. Binary outcome.
- **Option B:** $5,000 in Tech Stock X, $5,000 in Healthcare Stock Y (which tends to move differently).
  - If tech drops 40% and healthcare rises 10%: You lose only 15% total, not 40%
  - If tech rises 30% and healthcare drops 5%: You gain 12.5% total
  - Your range of outcomes is narrower—less extreme in both directions"

**Key Insight:**
"By combining assets that don't move in perfect lockstep, you keep most of the upside potential while cutting downside risk significantly."

**Visual Aid:**
If possible, show a chart of a 100% stock portfolio vs. 60/40 stock/bond portfolio over 20 years:
- Similar average returns (maybe 9% vs. 8%)
- Dramatically different max losses (maybe -45% vs. -22%)

#### Part 2: Asset Classes and Correlation (4 minutes)
**0:18-0:22**

**Facilitation:**
Create a simple correlation matrix on the board showing major asset classes.

**Matrix Example:**
```
              US Stock  Bonds  Intl Stock  Gold   Cash
US Stocks        1.0     -0.1     +0.7    +0.1   0.0
Bonds           -0.1      1.0     -0.3    +0.2   0.0
Intl Stocks     +0.7     -0.3      1.0    +0.1   0.0
Gold            +0.1     +0.2     +0.1     1.0   0.0
Cash             0.0      0.0      0.0     0.0   1.0
```

**Discussion:**
- "US stocks and international stocks have +0.7 correlation—they're similar but not identical. Some diversification benefit."
- "US stocks and bonds have -0.1 correlation—they move independently or slightly opposite. Great diversification."
- "Why does this matter? If you only own US stocks and add international stocks, you get some benefit but not huge. If you add bonds, you get much more diversification."

**Interactive Element:**
"If you wanted to reduce risk as much as possible, which two assets would you combine?" (US stocks and bonds, due to negative/low correlation)

#### Part 3: Asset Allocation Strategies (4 minutes)
**0:22-0:26**

**Facilitation:**
Show concrete examples of different allocations appropriate for different ages.

**Create Visual Comparison:**
```
Age 25 (40 years to retirement):
90% Stocks (aggressive growth) / 10% Bonds
Expected return: 9-10% | Max crash: -35 to -40%

Age 45 (20 years to retirement):
70% Stocks (balanced) / 30% Bonds
Expected return: 7-9% | Max crash: -25 to -30%

Age 65 (in retirement):
40% Stocks (conservative) / 60% Bonds
Expected return: 5-7% | Max crash: -15 to -20%
```

**Key Principle:**
"As you age, you shift from growth to preservation. Why? Time. A 25-year-old who loses 40% in a crash has 40 years to recover and keep contributing. A 65-year-old who loses 40% might need to delay retirement or reduce lifestyle."

**Real Numbers Example:**
"$500/month invested from age 25 to 65 (40 years) at 9% (aggressive allocation) = approximately $2.2 million. The same at 6% (overly conservative for a young person) = approximately $950,000. Being too conservative when young costs $1.25 million."

**Teaching Point:**
"The biggest mistake young investors make is being too conservative. The biggest mistake older investors make is being too aggressive. Age-appropriate allocation is critical."

#### Part 4: Rebalancing Principles (2 minutes)
**0:26-0:28**

**Facilitation:**
Walk through a rebalancing scenario step-by-step.

**Example:**
- Start: $70,000 stocks, $30,000 bonds (70/30 allocation)
- After one year: Stocks rise 20%, bonds rise 3%
- New values: $84,000 stocks, $30,900 bonds
- New allocation: 73.1% stocks / 26.9% bonds
- Rebalance: Sell $3,540 in stocks, buy $3,540 in bonds
- Back to 70/30: $80,460 stocks / $34,440 bonds

**Why It Matters:**
"Without rebalancing, after a big stock run, you're taking more risk than you intended. After a stock crash, you're taking less risk than you need. Rebalancing keeps you on track and forces you to 'sell high' (stocks after they've surged) and 'buy low' (stocks after they've fallen)."

**Practical Guidance:**
"How often? Research shows annual rebalancing works well for most people. More frequent = higher costs, less frequent = more drift."

#### Part 5: Target-Date Funds (2 minutes)
**0:28-0:30**

**Facilitation:**
Explain these as "autopilot" diversification and rebalancing.

**Concept:**
"If all this allocation and rebalancing sounds complicated, target-date funds do it automatically. Pick a fund matching your retirement year—Target 2060 Fund if you're retiring around 2060—and it handles everything:
- Starts aggressive (90% stocks) when you're young
- Gradually shifts to conservative (30% stocks) as you approach retirement
- Rebalances automatically
- One fund, complete diversification"

**When They're Ideal:**
"Perfect for people who don't want to manage investments themselves. Most 401(k) plans offer them."

**Caution:**
"Different target-date funds use different strategies. Some are more aggressive, others more conservative. Know which you're using."

**Transition:** "These principles aren't just theory. Let's see how they played out for real investors."

### Real-World Examples (10 minutes)
**0:30-0:40**

**Facilitation Strategy:**
Don't just read the examples. Create discussion around each.

#### Example 1: Aaliyah's Automatic Target-Date Strategy (3 minutes)

**Key Points:**
- 24-year-old, chose Target 2060 Fund, contributed $400/month consistently
- Never changed allocation—fund handled everything automatically
- During 35% market crash, kept contributing, buying low
- By age 39, $95,000 contributed had grown to $142,000
- On track for $2.1 million by retirement

**Discussion Questions:**
- Why was staying invested during the crash critical to Aaliyah's success?
- How did automatic rebalancing help her "buy low, sell high" without thinking about it?
- What's the advantage of a target-date fund for someone who doesn't want to manage investments?

**Key Lesson:**
"Simple, consistent, disciplined investing with proper diversification beats trying to time markets or pick hot stocks."

#### Example 2: Marcus's DIY Diversification and Crisis Management (3 minutes)

**Key Points:**
- 45-year-old, self-managed 70/30 portfolio
- During 40% stock crash, his diversification limited total loss to 26%
- Rebalanced during crash: sold bonds, bought stocks on sale
- Recovered to $392,000, then grew to $1.4 million by age 60

**Discussion Questions:**
- Why did selling bonds to buy stocks during a crash feel wrong but end up being right?
- What would have happened if Marcus panicked and sold stocks at the bottom?
- How did his 70/30 allocation limit his maximum loss compared to 100% stocks?

**Key Lesson:**
"Disciplined rebalancing forces you to do the right thing when emotions scream to do the wrong thing."

#### Example 3: Destiny's Undiversified Lesson (3 minutes)

**Key Points:**
- 28-year-old, put $25,000 entirely in tech stocks and Bitcoin
- Grew to $95,000 (280% gain), then crashed to $38,000 (60% loss from peak)
- Panic-sold at bottom, locking in losses
- Friend Jordan with diversified portfolio had smoother path, ended with more wealth
- Destiny sat in cash during recovery, Jordan grew to $74,000

**Discussion Questions:**
- Why did Destiny's concentrated approach seem brilliant until it didn't?
- What psychological damage did the crash do beyond just money lost?
- How did Jordan's diversification keep confidence intact to stay invested?

**Key Lesson:**
"Concentration can create spectacular gains, but without diversification, one sector's collapse destroys wealth AND confidence. Diversification's true value is enabling you to stay invested through crashes."

**Comparative Discussion (1 minute):**
"Which approach would you take: Aaliyah's automatic target-date, Marcus's self-managed disciplined approach, or Destiny's concentrated bet? What's the risk and benefit of each?"

**Transition:** "Let's think about your own future investing."

---

### Reflection Discussion (5 minutes)
**0:40-0:45**

**Activity:** Students assess their personal risk tolerance and appropriate allocation.

**Reflection Prompt:**
"Think about when you'll realistically start investing—maybe your first job at 22-25, or using graduation money. If you were investing $500/month starting today with plans to use the money in 30-40 years:

- What stock/bond allocation makes you comfortable enough to stay invested through a 30% crash?
- How would that allocation change as you age over those 30-40 years?
- What rebalancing commitment would you make? (Annual? When drift exceeds 5%?)
- Would you use a target-date fund or self-manage?"

**Facilitation Options:**
1. Written individual reflection (private)
2. Think-pair-share with partner
3. Voluntary sharing with class

**If Using Discussion:**
Prompt: "Who's willing to share what allocation strategy they'd use and why?"

Expect responses like:
- "I'd do 90% stocks because I'm young and have time"
- "I'd use a target-date fund so I don't have to think about it"
- "I'd do 70/30 because 90% stocks feels too risky"

**Address Common Responses:**
- For overly conservative young investors: "Remember, being too conservative when young has a huge opportunity cost. Run the numbers."
- For overly aggressive investors: "Can you truly watch your portfolio drop 40% without panicking? Be honest."

**Transition:** "Let's build some actual portfolios and see how they perform."

### Skill Builder Introduction (10 minutes)
**0:45-0:55**

**Activity:** Introduce Portfolio Diversification Builder and begin exploration.

**Tool Overview (3 minutes):**
The Portfolio Diversification Builder allows students to:
- Select asset allocations across stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities
- Simulate portfolio performance through historical market cycles
- See how different allocations affect maximum drawdowns, volatility, and returns
- Compare concentrated vs. diversified strategies
- Test the impact of rebalancing vs. not rebalancing

**Demonstration (3 minutes):**
Walk through one example together:
1. Build a portfolio: 100% US Large-Cap Stocks
2. Run simulation through a market crash and recovery
3. Show maximum drawdown and final value
4. Build second portfolio: 70% Stocks, 30% Bonds
5. Run same simulation
6. Compare: Did diversification reduce max loss? How did returns compare?

**Student Exploration (4 minutes):**
Students should:
1. Select one of three provided investor profiles (age 25, 45, or 60)
2. Build an age-appropriate allocation
3. Run the simulation
4. Try modifying the allocation and seeing how results change

**Circulate and Assist:**
- Help with technical issues
- Point out cause-and-effect: "Notice what happened to maximum loss when you added bonds?"
- Encourage testing multiple strategies

**Closure:**
"Tomorrow's learning lab, you'll build multiple portfolios, test them through crisis scenarios, and practice rebalancing. Tonight, think about what allocation strategy makes sense for your age and risk tolerance."

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Advanced Students
- Challenge to find the "optimal" portfolio on the efficient frontier (best return for given risk)
- Calculate correlation coefficients from raw return data
- Research the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and beta
- Explore factor investing (value, momentum, quality factors)

### For Struggling Students
- Simplify to just two asset classes (stocks and bonds) instead of full range
- Provide completed correlation matrix rather than requiring interpretation
- Focus on age-based allocation rule ("120 minus age") without complex optimization
- Use target-date funds as primary recommendation (less complex decision-making)

### For English Language Learners
- Pre-teach vocabulary: correlation, allocation, rebalancing, volatility, diversification
- Provide visual aids extensively (pie charts, line graphs showing allocations)
- Use bilingual finance glossaries if available
- Allow extra time on skill builder with one-on-one support

### For Diverse Learners
- Acknowledge that this assumes access to investment accounts; not all families have this yet
- Frame as preparation for future opportunities (401(k) at first job, investing gifts/inheritance)
- Recognize different cultural attitudes toward investing (some cultures emphasize real estate over stocks)
- Provide calculator support for percentage and growth calculations

## Common Misconceptions and Challenges

### Misconception 1: "Diversification means you can't lose money"
**Reality:** Diversification reduces risk but doesn't eliminate it. Systematic (market-wide) risk affects all assets. Even perfectly diversified portfolios fall during recessions.

**How to Address:** Show that in 2008, even diversified portfolios fell 25-35%. But concentrated portfolios fell 50-70%. "Diversification makes crashes survivable, not prevents them entirely."

### Misconception 2: "You should diversify by buying many different stocks"
**Reality:** Buying 20 different tech stocks isn't real diversification—they're all correlated. True diversification requires different asset classes.

**How to Address:** "If you own Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google, and Meta, you're not diversified—if tech crashes, you crash. But owning stocks + bonds + real estate = different asset classes that move differently."

### Misconception 3: "Rebalancing means selling my winners, which is bad"
**Reality:** Selling winners after they've surged locks in gains at high prices. Not rebalancing means taking on more risk than intended.

**How to Address:** "Imagine you start with $7,000 stocks, $3,000 bonds. Stocks triple to $21,000. You now have $21,000 stocks, $3,000 bonds—88% stocks! That's way riskier than your 70/30 plan. Rebalancing locks in some of those gains and manages risk."

### Misconception 4: "Young people should be conservative because they don't have much money to lose"
**Reality:** Young people should be aggressive because they have TIME to recover from losses and time for growth to compound.

**How to Address:** Show the math. "$10,000 invested at 9% (aggressive) for 40 years = $314,000. Same at 5% (conservative) = $70,000. Being too conservative when young costs you $244,000 on just $10,000."

### Challenge: Math Anxiety
Some students struggle with percentages, growth calculations, and correlation coefficients.

**How to Address:** Provide calculators and spreadsheet tools. Focus on conceptual understanding ("positive correlation means move together, negative means move opposite") rather than perfect numerical precision. Use visuals (pie charts, line graphs) to show relationships.

### Challenge: Seems Too Far in the Future
For high school students, retirement feels impossibly distant.

**How to Address:** Frame as decisions they'll face at age 22-25 with first job 401(k). Discuss using inheritance, gift money, or summer job savings. Show how 5-10 years of disciplined investing creates significant wealth even before retirement.

- During Key Concepts: Check understanding of correlation with quick examples
- During Deeper Exploration: Ask students to design allocation for given age/risk scenario
- During Real-World Examples: Identify what each investor did right or wrong
- During Skill Builder: Observe whether students understand risk-return tradeoffs

### Summative Assessment (end of two-day sequence)
- Design age-appropriate portfolios for three different investors
- Explain why specific asset allocation reduces risk compared to concentration
- Calculate rebalancing trades needed to restore target allocation
- Analyze a concentrated portfolio and recommend diversification improvements
- Explain correlation's role in portfolio risk reduction
