# L-64: Risk and Return in Investing - Teacher Guide (Day 1)

## Lesson Overview
This lesson introduces students to the fundamental relationship between investment risk and potential returns, equipping them with the conceptual framework and analytical tools to make informed investment decisions throughout their lives. Students will learn that higher returns require accepting higher risk, explore the difference between systematic and unsystematic risk, master key risk metrics (standard deviation, beta, Sharpe ratio), and understand how to match investments to their personal risk tolerance and time horizon. The lesson emphasizes that successful investing isn't about eliminating risk—it's about understanding, measuring, and managing risk appropriately for one's individual circumstances.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Analyze the relationship between investment risk and potential returns, understanding the risk-return tradeoff
- Evaluate different types of investment risk including systematic (market-wide) and unsystematic (company-specific) risk
- Calculate and interpret key risk metrics including standard deviation, beta, and Sharpe ratio
- Assess personal risk tolerance based on time horizon, financial situation, and emotional temperament
- Create age-appropriate investment strategies that balance risk and return objectives

## Preparation

### Content Review
1. Review student-facing content thoroughly, especially the three real-world examples
2. Familiarize yourself with risk metric calculations (practice calculating standard deviation, beta, Sharpe ratio)
3. Review Risk-Return Investment Analyzer functionality
4. Prepare to explain complex concepts (like standard deviation) in accessible language

### Materials Needed
- Presentation slides or board for visual aids
- Calculator for demonstrations
- Chart showing historical stock market returns (30+ years)
- Visual representation of risk-return tradeoff (scatter plot)
- Sample investment prospectus or fact sheet
- Access to Risk-Return Investment Analyzer for demonstration

### Visual Aids to Prepare
1. **Risk-Return Scatterplot:** X-axis = risk (standard deviation), Y-axis = return, plot different asset classes
2. **Historical Returns Chart:** Line graph showing S&P 500 from 1990-present with notable crashes highlighted
3. **Diversification Demonstration:** Visual showing how adding more stocks reduces unsystematic risk
4. **Age-Based Allocation Chart:** Show appropriate stock/bond mix at ages 25, 45, 65
5. **Sharpe Ratio Comparison:** Bar chart showing how different investments compare on risk-adjusted basis

### Optional Enhancements
- Guest speaker: Financial advisor to discuss risk management in real practice
- Bring in actual mutual fund prospectuses showing risk ratings
- Create anonymous class survey on risk tolerance to discuss results
- Show clips from financial crisis coverage (2008) to illustrate volatility impact

### State-Specific Considerations
**Note:** L-64 is Tier 3 (fully agnostic)—no state-specific variables needed. Investment risk and return principles are universal. However, you may want to:
- Reference local companies in examples (students might relate better)
- Connect to state retirement systems if relevant (public employee pensions, etc.)
- Mention state-specific college savings plans (529s) when discussing long-term investing

## Detailed Lesson Plan

### Hook & Introduction (5 minutes)

**Opening Scenario:**
"Imagine two investment offers. Investment A promises steady 3% annual returns with virtually no risk—your money will absolutely be there. Investment B has averaged 10% annual returns but had years where it lost 30% of its value. You're 22 years old investing for retirement at 65. Which should you choose?"

**Facilitation:**
- Present the scenario visually
- Poll students: Quick show of hands for Investment A vs. Investment B
- Ask a few students to explain their reasoning
- Key point: Many students instinctively choose safety, but this could cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars over 40+ years
- Reveal the lesson focus: Understanding risk and return is one of the most important financial skills you'll ever learn

**Bridge to Content:**
"Today we're going to learn why sometimes taking MORE risk is actually the smarter choice, how to measure risk objectively, and how to choose the right level of risk for YOUR situation. By the end of class, you'll be able to make that investment decision with confidence and mathematical backing."

**Set Learning Objectives:**
- Preview what students will be able to do by end of lesson
- Emphasize practical application: "These aren't just academic concepts—you'll use these skills every time you make an investment decision for the next 60+ years"

### Key Concepts (10 minutes)
**Delivery Method:** Direct instruction with visual aids and interactive checks

**1. Investment Risk (2 minutes)**
"Risk is the possibility that your investment's actual return will differ from what you expected—including losing some or all of your money."

- **Not the same as losing money:** Even gains can be "risky" if they're unpredictable
- **Measured by volatility:** How much returns fluctuate
- **Examples:**
  - Low risk: FDIC-insured savings account (know exactly what you'll earn)
  - High risk: Individual stock (could double or drop to zero)

**Visual:** Show two line graphs—one flat (savings account), one jagged (stock)

**Check for understanding:** "True or false: An investment that gained 50% last year has no risk." (False—high volatility in either direction indicates risk)

**2. Return (1 minute)**
"Return is what you gain or lose on an investment, expressed as a percentage of what you invested. Includes both price changes and income (dividends, interest)."

- **Example:** Invest $1,000, one year later it's worth $1,100 and you received $30 in dividends. Total return: ($100 + $30) / $1,000 = 13%

**3. Risk-Return Tradeoff (3 minutes)**
"The fundamental principle: Higher potential returns require accepting higher risk. You can't have high returns AND high safety."

- **Why this exists:** If a safe investment offered 20% returns, everyone would buy it, driving the price up until returns fell
- **Visual aid:** Scatterplot with different asset classes
  - Bottom-left: Cash/savings (low risk, low return)
  - Middle: Bonds (moderate risk, moderate return)
  - Top-right: Stocks (high risk, high return)
  - Far top-right: Speculative investments (very high risk, very high potential return)

**Real-world application:** "When someone promises 'guaranteed high returns with no risk,' that's a red flag for fraud. The risk-return tradeoff is economic law."

**4. Volatility (2 minutes)**
"Volatility measures how much an investment's price fluctuates over time."

- **High volatility:** Prices swing dramatically up and down
- **Low volatility:** Prices stay relatively stable
- **Important distinction:** Volatility measures unpredictability, not necessarily losses
- **Visual:** Show two investments with same 10-year average return but vastly different volatility paths

**Student connection:** "Have you ever checked crypto prices and seen them change 10% in an hour? That's extreme volatility. Compare that to checking your savings account balance—almost no volatility."

**5. Systematic vs. Unsystematic Risk (2 minutes)**
This is complex but crucial—use clear examples.

**Systematic Risk (Market Risk):**
- Affects entire market or large segments
- **Cannot** be eliminated through diversification
- Examples: Recession, inflation, interest rate changes, pandemic
- "The price of admission to investing in markets"

**Unsystematic Risk (Company-Specific Risk):**
- Affects individual companies or industries
- **Can** be eliminated through diversification
- Examples: CEO resigns, product recall, lawsuit, competition
- "The risk you can control through smart portfolio construction"

**Visual:** Two pie charts
- Portfolio 1: One stock (both systematic and unsystematic risk)
- Portfolio 2: 30 stocks (mostly systematic risk, minimal unsystematic)

**Check for understanding:** "If there's a recession and the whole market falls 20%, is that systematic or unsystematic risk?" (Systematic) "If one company's CEO is caught in scandal and its stock drops 40% while the market stays flat?" (Unsystematic)

### Deeper Exploration (15 minutes)

**SECTION 1: Understanding the Risk-Return Relationship (4 minutes)**

**Historical Evidence:**
Present actual historical returns (approximate, 1990-2020):
- Cash/Savings: 1-3% annually
- Government Bonds: 3-5% annually
- Corporate Bonds: 4-7% annually
- Stocks: 8-12% annually (with much higher volatility)

**The Power of Compounding Over Time:**
Do a quick calculation on the board:
- $10,000 invested for 40 years at 3% = $32,620
- $10,000 invested for 40 years at 10% = $452,593
- **Difference: $419,973**

"This is why young people should usually take more risk—time allows volatility to smooth out while compound growth magnifies returns."

**Critical caveat:** "Past performance doesn't guarantee future results. These are historical averages with huge year-to-year variation."

**SECTION 2: Measuring Risk with Quantitative Tools (6 minutes)**

**Standard Deviation (2 minutes):**
"Statistics measure of volatility—shows how much returns typically vary from average."

**Simple explanation:**
- Stock A averages 10% with standard deviation of 5%: Most years, returns fall between 5% and 15%
- Stock B averages 10% with standard deviation of 20%: Most years, returns fall between -10% and +30%
- Both average 10%, but Stock B is much riskier

**Demonstration:** Show two investments on board with actual yearly returns, calculate standard deviation (or use calculator), discuss interpretation

**Beta (2 minutes):**
"Measures how volatile an investment is relative to the overall market."

**Framework:**
- Market beta = 1.0 (by definition)
- Beta > 1.0 = More volatile than market (e.g., beta of 1.5 moves 50% more)
- Beta < 1.0 = Less volatile than market (e.g., beta of 0.7 moves 30% less)
- Beta near 0 = No correlation with market (e.g., Treasury bonds)

**Example:** "If market rises 10% and your stock has beta of 1.3, expect it to rise about 13%. But if market falls 10%, expect it to fall about 13%. Amplifies both gains AND losses."

**Sharpe Ratio (2 minutes):**
"Combines return and risk into single measure—shows return per unit of risk taken."

**Formula:** (Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Standard Deviation

**Example calculation on board:**
- Investment A: 12% return, 20% standard deviation, 2% risk-free rate
- Sharpe ratio = (12% - 2%) / 20% = 0.50
- Interpretation: "For every unit of risk, you get 0.50 units of excess return"

**Why it matters:** "Allows apples-to-apples comparison. Sometimes a lower-return investment with low volatility has better Sharpe ratio than high-return investment with extreme volatility."

**SECTION 3: Risk Tolerance and Personal Factors (5 minutes)**

**Time Horizon (2 minutes):**
"How long until you need the money is THE most important factor in appropriate risk level."

**Visual aid:** Age-based allocation chart
- Age 25: 80-90% stocks, 10-20% bonds (aggressive)
- Age 45: 60-70% stocks, 30-40% bonds (moderate)
- Age 65: 30-40% stocks, 60-70% bonds (conservative)

**Why:** "Stocks are volatile short-term but have never had negative returns over any 20-year period historically. If you have 40 years, you can ride out crashes. If you have 2 years, you can't risk a 30% loss."

**Financial Situation (1 minute):**
Quick checklist on board:
- ✓ Stable income → Can afford more risk
- ✓ Emergency fund established → Can afford more risk
- ✓ Low debt → Can afford more risk
- ✗ Living paycheck-to-paycheck → Should minimize risk

**Emotional Temperament (2 minutes):**
"Be honest with yourself—some people panic during downturns, others stay calm."

**Story:** "I know someone who had a perfectly good long-term portfolio, but during the 2008 crash, they sold everything at the bottom, locking in huge losses, then missed the entire recovery. They couldn't handle the emotional stress of volatility. A less aggressive portfolio they could stick with would have been better."

**Key point:** "A conservative portfolio you maintain is better than an aggressive portfolio you abandon at the worst moment."

**Self-assessment questions:**
- Can you watch your portfolio decline 20% without panic-selling?
- Do you check your investments constantly and stress about fluctuations?
- Have you ever made an emotional financial decision you regretted?

### Real-World Examples (10 minutes)
**Delivery Method:** Guided reading and analysis

**Example 1: Emma's Age-Appropriate Risk Strategy (3 minutes)**

**Read scenario together** (have student volunteer read aloud or you narrate)

**Discussion questions:**
- "Why did Emma choose the aggressive fund while Sarah chose the stable value fund?" (Different time horizons and needs)
- "What's the projected difference in their final account values?" ($227k vs. $1.9 million—huge)
- "Is Emma taking 'too much risk'?" (No—appropriate for 40-year horizon, and she committed to not panic-selling)
- "What's Emma's strategy for handling market crashes?" (Never check during downturns, keep contributing automatically)

**Key lesson:** "Age and time horizon should drive your risk decisions. What's perfect for Emma would be reckless for Sarah, and vice versa."

**Example 2: Marcus's Painful Volatility Lesson (4 minutes)**

**Read scenario together**

**Critical analysis:**
- "What mistakes did Marcus make?" (Concentrated entire portfolio in single stock, massive unsystematic risk)
- "How much did he lose in the crash?" (74% of portfolio value)
- "Could diversification have protected him?" (Yes—in a broad index, this company would be ~0.1%, barely noticeable)
- "Why did he sell at the bottom?" (Panic, emotional decision)
- "What does he need to do to recover to $18,000?" (201% gain—possible but difficult)

**Have students calculate:**
- If Marcus had stayed in his diversified index fund during the biotech crash, how much would he likely have lost? (Essentially nothing—one small company in a huge index)

**Key lesson:** "Taking APPROPRIATE risk is different from gambling. Marcus learned the hard way why diversification matters."

**Example 3: Jasmine's Risk-Adjusted Decision (3 minutes)**

**Read scenario together**

**Work through the math:**
- Fund A: 14% return, 28% standard deviation, Sharpe ratio = 0.43
- Fund B: 10% return, 15% standard deviation, Sharpe ratio = 0.53
- "Fund B is actually better on a risk-adjusted basis"

**Discussion:**
- "Why did Jasmine choose the fund with LOWER returns?" (Better risk-adjusted returns, better match for her risk tolerance)
- "What did she understand about herself?" (High volatility would cause her to make emotional decisions)
- "Is she 'playing it too safe'?" (No—choosing sustainable strategy she can stick with)

**Key lesson:** "The theoretically best investment on paper is worthless if volatility causes you to abandon your strategy. Know yourself."

### Skill Builder Introduction (10 minutes)

**Overview of Tool:**
"The Risk-Return Investment Analyzer lets you explore six different investment options, see their risk metrics, and build portfolios for different risk profiles."

**Demonstrate the six investment options:**
Display each briefly and point out key features:
- Option A: High-yield savings (2%, SD 0.5%, beta 0.0) - "Super safe, super low return"
- Option B: Short-term bonds (3.5%, SD 3%, beta 0.1) - "Slightly more risk, slightly more return"
- Option C: Balanced fund (7%, SD 10%, beta 0.6) - "Middle ground"
- Option D: Large-cap stock index (10%, SD 18%, beta 1.0) - "Market average"
- Option E: Small-cap growth (13%, SD 28%, beta 1.4) - "Higher risk, higher return"
- Option F: Emerging markets (15%, SD 35%, beta 1.6) - "Highest risk, highest potential"

**Show how to build a portfolio:**
Walk through creating a simple portfolio allocation:
- "Let's build a moderate portfolio for a 40-year-old"
- Allocate: 20% A, 40% D, 20% C, 10% B, 10% E
- Show how calculator computes weighted average return
- Show how it calculates portfolio standard deviation
- Interpret the results

**Explain the three investor profiles:**
- Profile 1 (Conservative, age 60): "Can't afford losses, needs stability"
- Profile 2 (Moderate, age 40): "Needs growth but manageable risk"
- Profile 3 (Aggressive, age 25): "Long horizon, maximize growth"

**Assignment for remaining time:**
"Use the analyzer to explore each investment option. Look at the historical return patterns, volatility visualizations, and risk metrics. Then try building a portfolio for one of the three profiles. We'll do much more with this tomorrow in the Learning Lab."

**Circulate and assist:**
- Help students navigate the tool
- Answer questions about metrics
- Encourage experimentation

### Summary & Preview (5 minutes)

**Recap Key Concepts:**
"Let's recap the most important ideas from today:"

1. "Risk and return are inseparably linked—higher returns require higher risk"
2. "There are two types of risk: systematic (can't eliminate) and unsystematic (can eliminate through diversification)"
3. "We measure risk objectively using standard deviation, beta, and Sharpe ratio"
4. "Your appropriate risk level depends on time horizon, financial situation, and emotional temperament"
5. "Age-appropriate investing is essential—what's smart at 25 is reckless at 60"

**Check for Understanding:**
Quick oral quiz:
- "What's the Sharpe ratio measuring?" (Risk-adjusted return)
- "Can you diversify away systematic risk?" (No)
- "Who should take more investment risk—someone investing for 40 years or 2 years?" (40 years)

**Preview Day 2:**
"Tomorrow's Learning Lab is all hands-on. You'll:
- Complete a risk tolerance assessment to discover YOUR risk profile
- Calculate actual risk metrics for different investments
- Build complete portfolios for three different investor profiles
- Analyze historical market volatility and make decisions
- This is where concepts become practical skills you'll use for life"

**Homework (if assigning):**
- "Think about your own time horizon for major financial goals"
- "Reflect on your honest reaction to volatility—could you handle seeing your investments drop 20%?"
- "Optional: Research one investment (stock, fund, etc.) and find its beta and standard deviation"

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Advanced Students
- **Challenge calculation:** Have them calculate standard deviation by hand for a sample dataset
- **Research assignment:** Investigate Modern Portfolio Theory and the efficient frontier
- **Analysis project:** Compare Sharpe ratios of 10 different mutual funds and present findings
- **Extension question:** "How do correlation coefficients affect portfolio risk when combining investments?"
- **Peer teaching:** Have them explain beta or Sharpe ratio to struggling students in their own words

### For Struggling Students
- **Simplified metrics:** Focus on just standard deviation initially; add beta and Sharpe ratio later
- **Visual learners:** Use more charts and graphs, fewer formulas
- **Concrete examples:** Stick with the three real-world scenarios; skip abstract calculations
- **Guided notes:** Provide fill-in-the-blank worksheet for key concepts
- **One-on-one check-ins:** Verify understanding before moving to next concept
- **Analogies:** "Standard deviation is like the difference between a calm lake and choppy ocean—both are water, but one is much more unpredictable"

### For English Language Learners (ELL)
- **Vocabulary support:** Create glossary with definitions in student's first language if possible
- **Visual aids:** Heavy use of charts, graphs, and visual representations over text
- **Sentence frames:** Provide templates for discussion responses
- **Bilingual partners:** Pair with bilingual student for peer support if available
- **Reduced language load:** Focus on concepts over technical terminology initially
- **Demonstration:** Show calculations step-by-step with minimal narration

### For Diverse Learners
- **Multiple representations:** Present concepts verbally, visually, and kinesthetically
- **Real-world connections:** Use examples from students' lives and communities
- **Choice in examples:** Let students choose which real-world scenario to analyze deeply
- **Technology options:** Offer calculator, spreadsheet, or online tools based on preference
- **Flexible pacing:** Some students may need more time with calculations
- **Multiple assessment options:** Written reflection, oral presentation, or practical demonstration

## Common Misconceptions and Challenges

### Misconception 1: "Higher risk always means higher returns"
**Reality:** Higher risk means higher POTENTIAL returns, not guaranteed returns. You can take high risk and still lose money.

**How to address:** Use the emerging markets example from Day 1 content—highest risk but actually lower Sharpe ratio than safer options. Sometimes high risk is poorly compensated.

### Misconception 2: "Diversification eliminates all risk"
**Reality:** Diversification only eliminates unsystematic risk. Systematic risk remains.

**How to address:** "Even if you own every stock in the market, you still face systematic risk. In 2008, almost everything fell. Diversification protects you from company-specific problems, not market-wide crashes."

### Misconception 3: "I should always maximize my Sharpe ratio"
**Reality:** Sharpe ratio is one tool, but personal circumstances matter more.

**How to address:** "A conservative bond fund might have a great Sharpe ratio, but if you're 22, you'd be sacrificing massive long-term growth. Use Sharpe ratio to compare similar investments, not as the only decision criterion."

### Misconception 4: "If I just avoid the stock market, I avoid all risk"
**Reality:** There's inflation risk, opportunity cost risk, and longevity risk (outliving your money).

**How to address:** Show the calculation of $10,000 at 3% vs. 10% over 40 years. "The 'risk' of staying too conservative is ending up with $400,000 less. That's a very real risk."

### Misconception 5: "Past performance predicts future results"
**Reality:** Historical returns are instructive but not predictive.

**How to address:** "Every investment prospectus says 'past performance does not guarantee future results' for a reason. We use history to understand patterns and risk levels, not to predict exact future returns."

### Misconception 6: "Standard deviation is too complicated for me to use"
**Reality:** The concept is simpler than the math—it's just a measure of unpredictability.

**How to address:** "You don't need to calculate it by hand—websites show it for every investment. You just need to know: higher number = more volatile = riskier."

### Challenge: Math anxiety with statistics
**Solution:**
- Emphasize understanding over calculation
- Use calculators and tools, not hand calculations
- Focus on interpretation: "What does a Sharpe ratio of 0.5 mean?" not "Calculate this Sharpe ratio"
- Provide step-by-step calculation guides for interested students

### Challenge: "This doesn't apply to me—I have no money to invest"
**Solution:**
- "You're learning this NOW so you're prepared when you do have money to invest"
- "These principles apply to any amount—whether you're investing $50 or $50,000"
- "Understanding this helps you evaluate job retirement plans, which you'll have soon"

### Challenge: Students want to day-trade or chase hot stocks
**Solution:**
- Acknowledge the appeal but present evidence: "95% of day traders lose money"
- Share Marcus's story as cautionary tale
- "If it were easy to beat the market, everyone would do it and it wouldn't work anymore"
- Channel enthusiasm: "If you want to try individual stocks, limit it to 5-10% of portfolio—treat it as education, not your primary strategy"

**Teaching Tips:**

1. **Make it personal:** The more students connect this to their actual future, the more they engage. Ask about their real retirement timelines, real goals.

2. **Use current events:** If there's recent market volatility, reference it explicitly. "Remember last month when the market dropped 5% in one day? That's volatility—let's talk about whether that should change your investment strategy."

3. **Normalize math anxiety:** Many students fear statistics. Emphasize understanding over calculation. "The math describes reality—focus on the reality, use calculators for the math."

4. **Challenge the get-rich-quick mentality:** Many students are drawn to cryptocurrency, day trading, meme stocks. Acknowledge the appeal, present the evidence, let them draw informed conclusions.

5. **Celebrate long-term thinking:** Young people taking a 40-year perspective on investing are rare and should be praised. This is sophisticated financial thinking.

6. **Be honest about limitations:** We can't predict the future. Historical patterns inform but don't guarantee. Teach humility along with confidence.
