# L-64: Risk and Return in Investing - Teacher Guide (Day 2: Learning Lab)

## Learning Lab Overview
**L-Chapter:** 64 - Risk and Return in Investing
**Duration:** 55 minutes
**Format:** Hands-on portfolio analysis and construction activities
**Teacher Role:** Coach and facilitator, not lecturer—circulate, observe, and assist
**Key Focus:** Practical application of risk assessment and portfolio building skills

Today's Learning Lab transforms yesterday's theoretical understanding into practical investment analysis and decision-making skills. Students will assess their own risk tolerance, calculate actual risk metrics for investments, build portfolios for different life stages, and analyze historical market volatility. Your role is to facilitate discovery, ask probing questions, and help students connect concepts to their personal financial futures rather than providing direct instruction.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this Learning Lab, students will be able to:
- Complete a comprehensive risk tolerance assessment and interpret results accurately
- Calculate standard deviation, beta, and Sharpe ratio for real investment data
- Construct age-appropriate investment portfolios aligned with different risk profiles
- Analyze historical market volatility and make informed decisions about staying invested during downturns
- Apply risk-return principles to their personal investment timeline and goals

## Detailed Facilitation Guide

### Welcome & Setup (2 minutes)

**Opening:**
"Welcome to today's Learning Lab! Yesterday you learned the concepts of risk and return. Today, you're going to apply these skills hands-on. You'll assess your own risk tolerance, calculate real risk metrics, build actual investment portfolios, and make decisions using historical market data. This is practical work that directly applies to your financial future."

**Set Expectations:**
- "You'll complete four activities, each building different analytical skills"
- "Some activities are individual (risk assessment, calculations), others involve analysis and comparison"
- "Focus on accuracy over speed—take time to understand the numbers"
- "There are no 'wrong' answers for personal risk tolerance—be honest with yourself"
- "I'm here to coach and guide, not to tell you what to do"

**Logistics:**
- Confirm all students can access the Risk-Return Investment Analyzer
- Address any technical issues immediately
- Distribute any printable materials needed
- Start timer for Activity 1

**Facilitation Mindset:**
Your goal today is to help students discover their own investment approach through analysis and reflection. When students ask "Is this right?" respond with "What do the numbers tell you?" or "How does this align with the investor's situation?"

### Activity 1: Risk Tolerance Assessment and Analysis (12 minutes)

**Setup (1 minute):**
"First, you're going to complete a comprehensive risk tolerance assessment. This has three parts: time horizon, financial situation, and emotional temperament. Answer honestly—there's no 'right' score, only what's true for you."

**Student Work Time (8 minutes):**

**Circulate and observe:**
- Check that students are reading questions carefully
- Ensure they're answering honestly, not aspirationally
- Watch for students rushing—encourage thoughtful responses

**Coaching conversations:**
- If student seems confused: "What does this question mean to you? Let's break it down."
- If student is torn between answers: "Think about how you actually behaved in stressful financial situations, not how you wish you'd behave."
- If student gets extreme result (0-10 or 90-100): "Does this result surprise you? Does it match your self-perception?"

**Common issues to address:**
- **Students answering aspirationally:** "I want to be aggressive" vs. honest self-assessment
  - **Coach:** "There's no prize for high risk tolerance. Conservative investors can be very successful. Be honest about YOUR comfort level."

- **Confusion about time horizon:**
  - **Coach:** "When do you realistically need this money? Retirement? House down payment? Emergency fund? That determines appropriate risk."

- **Mismatch between components:** Long time horizon but low emotional tolerance
  - **Coach:** "Notice that your time horizon suggests one thing but your temperament suggests another. Your actual tolerance is the minimum—invest based on the constraining factor."

**Analysis and Reflection (3 minutes):**

**Prompt students to reflect:**
- "Look at your results. Are you Conservative, Moderate, or Aggressive?"
- "Does this match what you expected?"
- "Which of the three components (time, financial situation, temperament) is your biggest constraint?"
- "How might your tolerance change in 10, 20, or 30 years?"

**Facilitate brief discussion:**
- "Show of hands: Who got Conservative? Moderate? Aggressive?"
- "Anyone surprised by their results?"
- "Who found that different components pulled them in different directions?"

**Key teaching point:**
"Remember: Your risk tolerance will change throughout life. A 25-year-old SHOULD have higher tolerance than a 65-year-old. This isn't a personality test—it's a life-stage assessment. The same person will get different results at different ages, and that's exactly right."

### Activity 2: Investment Risk Metrics Calculator (15 minutes)

**Setup (1 minute):**
"Now you'll calculate actual risk metrics—standard deviation, beta, and Sharpe ratio—for six different investments. You'll use real historical return data. This is how professionals analyze investments before choosing them."

**Demonstrate one calculation (2 minutes):**
Walk through Investment A (Treasury Bonds) on board or screen:
- Show the 5-year return data: [3.2%, 2.8%, 3.5%, 3.0%, 3.1%]
- Calculate average: (3.2 + 2.8 + 3.5 + 3.0 + 3.1) ÷ 5 = 3.12%
- Explain standard deviation concept: "Measures how much returns vary from average"
- Show beta: 0.05 (nearly zero correlation with stock market)
- Calculate Sharpe ratio: (3.12% - 2.5%) ÷ 0.25% = 2.48

"The calculator does the math for you, but make sure you understand what each number means."

**Student Work Time (10 minutes):**

Students work through all six investments, calculating metrics and recording results.

**Circulate and provide targeted support:**

**For students struggling with calculations:**
- "Start with the average—that's just adding and dividing. Can you do that?"
- "The standard deviation shows volatility—look at Investment B vs. Investment C. Which has returns that jump around more?"
- "Don't worry about the exact formula. Focus on: higher number = more volatility."

**For students racing through:**
- "Don't just calculate—interpret. What does Investment C's beta of 1.4 tell you?"
- "Compare the Sharpe ratios. Which investment gives you the best return per unit of risk?"
- "Why does Investment D have high returns but a low Sharpe ratio? What does that tell you?"

**For all students, ask probing questions:**
- "Which investment has the highest raw return?" (Emerging Markets, 10.6%)
- "Which has the highest risk?" (Emerging Markets, 25.1% SD)
- "Which has the best Sharpe ratio?" (Treasury Bonds, 2.48)
- "Why isn't the highest return automatically the 'best' investment?" (Because risk matters)

**Common misconceptions to address:**

**Misconception:** "High-yield savings has negative Sharpe ratio (-2.0), so it's bad"
**Reality:** It's negative because returns are below the risk-free rate, but it still serves a purpose (emergency fund, short-term safety)
**Coach:** "Sharpe ratio compares to risk-free rate. Savings account is FOR safety, not growth. Don't use Sharpe ratio to evaluate short-term safety holdings."

**Misconception:** "Investment with highest return is best"
**Reality:** Must consider risk-adjusted returns
**Coach:** "Look at Emerging Markets—highest returns but lowest Sharpe ratio. You're taking lots of extra risk for limited extra return. Is that worth it?"

**Analysis Questions (2 minutes):**

Facilitate brief whole-class discussion:
- "Which investment surprised you most? Why?"
- "Would you personally invest in the investment with the highest Sharpe ratio? Why or why not?"
- "How does beta help you understand an investment's behavior during market crashes?"

**Key teaching moment:**
"Professional investors use these exact metrics. You now have the same analytical tools as financial advisors. The difference is experience interpreting them, but you have the foundation."

### Activity 3: Portfolio Construction for Different Risk Profiles (18 minutes)

**Setup (1 minute):**
"Now the fun part—building actual investment portfolios. You'll create three different portfolios for three different people: Maria (age 25, aggressive), David (age 45, moderate), and Sharon (age 63, conservative). Each portfolio uses the same six investments, but in very different proportions."

**Demonstrate portfolio allocation (2 minutes):**
Show Maria's suggested aggressive allocation on screen:
- Treasury Bonds: 0%
- Large-Cap Stocks: 50%
- Small-Cap Growth: 25%
- Emerging Markets: 15%
- Balanced Fund: 10%
- Savings: 0%
- **Total must equal 100%**

"The analyzer calculates weighted average return, portfolio standard deviation, beta, and Sharpe ratio. Then it projects what $300/month grows to over 40 years."

**Student Work Time (12 minutes):**

Students build and analyze all three portfolios.

**Circulate strategically:**

**Portfolio 1 - Maria (Aggressive):**
- Check students understand why high stock allocation is appropriate for 40-year horizon
- Ask: "Why is Maria allocated 0% to savings accounts and bonds?"
- Coach: "With 40 years, she can ride out volatility. Short-term losses don't matter."
- Challenge: "What if Maria increases emerging markets to 30%? What happens to risk and return?"

**Portfolio 2 - David (Moderate):**
- Verify students are balancing growth and stability
- Ask: "Why does David have more bonds than Maria?"
- Coach: "20-year horizon is long but not as long as Maria's. One bad market crash closer to retirement could hurt. He needs some stability."
- Discuss: "How does David's projected total compare to Maria's? Why the difference?"

**Portfolio 3 - Sharon (Conservative):**
- Ensure students understand capital preservation priority
- Ask: "Why does Sharon have so much in bonds and savings?"
- Coach: "She retires in 2 years. A 30% market crash would be devastating. She can't afford high volatility."
- Point out: "Notice Sharon still has 25% stocks. Even in retirement, she needs some growth for 20+ retirement years."

**Coaching conversations based on student work:**

**If student makes Maria too conservative:**
- "Look at the projected 40-year total with this allocation. Now compare to the aggressive allocation. What's the difference?"
- "With 40 years, Maria can absorb short-term volatility. What's the cost of being too conservative?" (Hundreds of thousands in lost growth)

**If student makes Sharon too aggressive:**
- "Sharon retires in 2 years. What happens if the market crashes 30% next year and her portfolio mirrors that?"
- "She can't wait 5-10 years for recovery. How does that change appropriate risk?"

**If students copy suggested allocations exactly:**
- "Those are suggestions, not requirements. Try different allocations and see what happens."
- "What if you make David slightly more aggressive—65% stocks instead of 55%? How does that change the projection?"

**Comparison and Analysis (3 minutes):**

Bring class together for discussion:

**Key questions:**
- "What's the biggest difference between the three portfolios?" (Risk level, stock vs. bond allocation)
- "Which portfolio has the highest projected value?" (Likely Maria's, due to time)
- "Which has the best Sharpe ratio?" (Often Sharon's—conservative but very efficient)
- "If you used Maria's portfolio for Sharon, what could go wrong?" (Crash right before retirement)
- "If you used Sharon's portfolio for Maria, what's the cost?" (Massive opportunity cost)

**Calculate the opportunity cost:**
Have students compare:
- Maria's aggressive portfolio: ~$1,623,000 over 40 years
- If Maria used Sharon's conservative approach: ~$850,000 over 40 years
- **Cost of being too conservative: ~$773,000**

"This is why age-appropriate investing matters. The 'safe' choice for Sharon would cost Maria three-quarters of a million dollars."

**Personal reflection (2 minutes):**
"Which of these three profiles is closest to your current life stage? What would YOUR appropriate portfolio look like right now? Think about YOUR time horizon, not theirs."

### Activity 4: Historical Volatility Analysis and Decision-Making (5 minutes)

**Note:** This is the shortest activity but potentially the most impactful emotionally.

**Setup (1 minute):**
"Final activity: We're going to look at real market history and you'll make a decision during a crisis. In 2008, the stock market crashed 37% in one year. If you were invested, what would you have done?"

**Present the scenario (1 minute):**
Show on screen or read:
- **January 2008:** You invest $10,000 in stock index fund
- **December 2008:** It's worth $6,300 (down 37%)
- **You need this money in 5 years for house down payment**
- **Your options:** Sell now? Hold? Buy more? Switch to bonds?

**Student decision time (2 minutes):**
- "Everyone write down privately: What would you do and why?"
- "Be honest—this is emotional, not just mathematical"

**Poll the class:**
- Show of hands: "Who would sell and cut losses?"
- "Who would hold?"
- "Who would buy more?"
- "Who would switch to less volatile investment?"

**Reveal the outcome (1 minute):**
Show what actually happened:
- Hold through 2008: $6,300
- By 2010: $8,100 (recovering)
- By 2012: $10,300 (breakeven)
- By 2013: $13,400 (30% profit from entry)
- By 2019: $22,900 (129% profit)

**Discuss:**
- "How many who said 'sell' now wish they'd held?"
- "How would you ACTUALLY have behaved if that was your real money?"
- "What does this teach us about volatility and time horizon?"

**Critical teaching moment:**
"The market has crashed many times—2000, 2008, 2020. Every single time, it recovered and went higher. The investors who won were those who stayed invested. The ones who lost were those who sold at the bottom in panic."

"But here's the honest part: SAYING you'd stay invested and ACTUALLY staying invested when your portfolio drops 37% are very different. This is why risk tolerance assessment matters—you need to be honest about your emotional capacity."

**Connect to earlier activities:**
"This is why we had you assess your temperament. If you KNOW you'd panic-sell during a crash, choose a less volatile portfolio you can actually stick with. Better to earn 7% consistently than to reach for 10% but bail out when it crashes."

### Reflection & Wrap-up (3 minutes)

**Personal Commitment (2 minutes):**

Have students complete individually:
- "My risk tolerance is: [Conservative / Moderate / Aggressive]"
- "My current time horizon is: ___ years"
- "My appropriate asset allocation is: ___% stocks, ___% bonds, ___% cash"
- "One thing I'll do differently in my investing: _______________"

**Share Out (1 minute):**
Ask 2-3 volunteers:
- "What was your biggest insight from today?"
- "What surprised you most?"
- "What will you do differently now?"

**Final Teaching Point:**
"What you learned today—assessing risk tolerance, calculating risk metrics, building age-appropriate portfolios, staying disciplined during volatility—these skills will serve you for the next 60+ years of investing. You now have the same analytical framework professional advisors use. The difference is practice and experience, which you'll build over time."

**Action Item:**
"In the next week, do ONE thing:
- Research one investment (fund, stock, ETF) and find its beta and Sharpe ratio
- Complete a risk tolerance assessment on a real investment platform (Vanguard, Fidelity)
- Calculate what $50/month invested over your remaining years until retirement could become
- Talk to a parent or adult about their investment approach and risk tolerance"

## Assessment & Monitoring

### Formative Assessment Strategies

**During Risk Tolerance Assessment:**
- Observe: Are students answering thoughtfully or rushing?
- Check for understanding: Do results surprise them? Can they explain why?
- Listen to reflections: Can they articulate their constraints (time, money, temperament)?

**During Risk Metrics Calculations:**
- Monitor accuracy: Are calculations correct? Do students fix errors?
- Assess interpretation: Can they explain what the numbers mean, not just calculate them?
- Probe understanding: "Why does this investment have high returns but low Sharpe ratio?"

**During Portfolio Construction:**
- Evaluate appropriateness: Do allocations match investor profiles?
- Check reasoning: Can students justify their choices?
- Test flexibility: What happens when they adjust allocations?

**During Historical Analysis:**
- Gauge emotional awareness: Do students understand their likely emotional reactions?
- Assess learning integration: Can they connect volatility to earlier risk concepts?
- Evaluate decision-making: Are choices aligned with stated risk tolerance?

### Observable Success Indicators

**Students "getting it":**
- Thoughtfully complete risk tolerance assessment, show understanding of results
- Calculate metrics accurately and interpret meaning correctly
- Build portfolios that genuinely match investor profiles (not just copying suggestions)
- Connect historical volatility to personal risk tolerance
- Make explicit links between time horizon and appropriate risk
- Ask sophisticated questions: "How does correlation affect portfolio risk?" or "What about rebalancing?"

**Students struggling:**
- Rush through risk assessment without reflection
- Calculate metrics but can't explain what they mean
- Build same portfolio for all three profiles
- Don't see connection between volatility and personal decisions
- Focus only on returns, ignore risk

**Intervention strategies:**
- One-on-one coaching: "Let's work through Maria's portfolio together step by step"
- Peer support: "Partner with someone who's finished and explain to each other"
- Simplification: "Focus on just two investments first—bonds and stocks. How would you allocate?"
- Visual aids: Show charts comparing the three portfolios side by side

### Exit Ticket Assessment

**Quick check (1-2 minutes at end):**

"On your way out, answer these three questions:"

1. "What's YOUR risk tolerance (conservative, moderate, aggressive) and what's the main factor determining it?"
2. "If Investment A has Sharpe ratio of 0.4 and Investment B has 0.7, which is better on a risk-adjusted basis?"
3. "True or False: A 25-year-old and a 65-year-old should have the same portfolio allocation." (False)

**Use exit tickets to:**
- Identify students who need follow-up
- Assess overall class understanding
- Adjust future lessons based on gaps

## Red Flags to Address

### Behavioral Red Flags

**Student displays gambling mentality:**
- "I'm going all-in on emerging markets—highest returns!"
- **Response:** "That's speculation, not investing. What happens if emerging markets crash 50%? Let's calculate the recovery time needed."

**Student is overly risk-averse:**
- "I'm putting everything in savings—I can't afford to lose money"
- **Response:** "Understand the opportunity cost. Let's calculate what you'd have in 40 years at 2% vs. 8%. The 'safe' choice costs you $____ in lost growth. That's also a risk."

**Student is paralyzed by options:**
- "There's too much to consider—I don't know what to do"
- **Response:** "Start simple. What's your time horizon? Long? Then more stocks. Short? More bonds. You can always adjust later."

### Conceptual Red Flags

**Confusing risk with losses:**
- "Low risk means I can't lose money"
- **Clarify:** "Low risk means more predictable returns, but you can still lose money. Even 'safe' investments have inflation risk."

**Misunderstanding diversification:**
- "I have three tech stocks—I'm diversified"
- **Clarify:** "That's three companies in one industry. You've reduced stock-picking risk slightly but still have huge technology sector risk. True diversification means different industries, sizes, and asset types."

**Overweighting recent performance:**
- "Emerging markets had the best returns—I should use those"
- **Clarify:** "Look at the standard deviation and Sharpe ratio. High past returns came with extremely high volatility. Are you prepared for 40% swings?"

**Believing they can time the market:**
- "I'll invest in stocks when they're low and sell when they're high"
- **Clarify:** "That sounds great but even professionals can't consistently do it. The 2008 scenario showed that timing requires perfect knowledge of the future. Time IN the market beats timing the market."

### Emotional Red Flags

**Student shows excessive stress about investing:**
- Appears anxious, overwhelmed, frozen
- **Response:** "Investing should match your temperament. If this level of volatility stresses you out, that's valuable self-knowledge. Choose a more conservative approach you can sustain."

**Student dismisses risk entirely:**
- "Market always goes up eventually—who cares about crashes?"
- **Response:** "That depends on your time horizon. 'Eventually' might be 10 years. Can you wait 10 years if you need the money in 2? Also, many individual stocks never recover. That's why we diversify."

**Student compares to others:**
- "My friend's dad is all in crypto—I should do that too"
- **Response:** "Your friend's dad might have different circumstances, risk tolerance, or might be taking risks he shouldn't. Focus on YOUR situation, not others'."

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Advanced Students

**Extend the challenge:**
- "Calculate the efficient frontier—what's the optimal risk-return combination?"
- "Research Modern Portfolio Theory and explain correlation coefficients"
- "Build a portfolio using 10 different investments, not just 6"
- "Back-test a portfolio using historical data from different time periods"
- "Explain how rebalancing affects long-term returns"

**Additional analysis:**
- Compare active vs. passive management using expense ratios
- Research factor investing (value, momentum, quality)
- Analyze how taxes affect investment returns
- Study behavioral finance and common investor mistakes

### For Struggling Students

**Simplify the task:**
- Start with just two investment options (stocks and bonds)
- Focus on one portfolio (themselves) instead of three profiles
- Use pre-made allocation templates they can adjust slightly
- Skip complex calculations, focus on interpretation
- Use visual portfolio pie charts instead of percentages

**Provide structure:**
- Fill-in-the-blank worksheets for calculations
- Step-by-step guided instructions for each activity
- Partner with stronger student for peer support
- One-on-one coaching during independent work time

**Concrete examples:**
- Use dollar amounts, not percentages: "$80 in stocks, $20 in bonds" vs. "80/20 allocation"
- Real-world analogies: "Portfolio is like a food pyramid—you need all food groups in right proportions"

### For English Language Learners (ELL)

**Language support:**
- Glossary of key terms in student's first language if available
- Visual representations of concepts (charts, graphs, diagrams)
- Sentence frames for reflections: "My risk tolerance is ___ because ___"
- Pair with bilingual student for translation support
- Reduce written reflections, allow verbal responses

**Simplified instructions:**
- Break activities into smaller steps
- Use numbered lists, not paragraphs
- Demonstrate each step before students begin
- Check understanding frequently

### For Diverse Learners

**Multiple modalities:**
- Visual: Charts, graphs, color-coded portfolios
- Auditory: Verbal explanations, discuss with partners
- Kinesthetic: Physical manipulation of allocation percentages, interactive tools

**Flexible pacing:**
- Some students may need more time with calculations
- Others may finish quickly and need extension activities
- Allow students to progress at own pace within reason

**Choice options:**
- Choose which investor profile to analyze first
- Select whether to use digital calculator or spreadsheet
- Decide format for final reflection (written, verbal, visual)

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Technology Issues

**Problem:** Risk-Return Investment Analyzer not loading
**Solution:**
- Have paper-based version ready with all investment data printed
- Students can use calculators and worksheets instead of digital tool
- Share device with partner if some devices work

**Problem:** Calculator giving incorrect results
**Solution:**
- Verify students are entering data correctly (decimals vs. percentages)
- Check for order of operations errors
- Provide step-by-step calculation guide
- Allow use of simple calculator and manual computation

### Content Issues

**Problem:** Students don't understand standard deviation calculation
**Solution:**
- De-emphasize the formula, focus on interpretation
- Use analogy: "It's like a weather forecast uncertainty range"
- Show visually with graphs of volatile vs. stable returns
- Emphasize: "You don't need to calculate it by hand—websites show it. Just understand what it means."

**Problem:** Students can't distinguish systematic from unsystematic risk
**Solution:**
- Use simple test: "If this happens, does it affect just one company or the whole market?"
- Examples: CEO scandal (unsystematic), recession (systematic)
- Connect to diversification: "Can you avoid it by owning many different stocks?"

**Problem:** Students build identical portfolios for all three profiles
**Solution:**
- Highlight the different time horizons explicitly
- Show the math: "Sharon has 2 years. If market crashes 35%, what happens?"
- Contrast with Maria: "She has 40 years. If market crashes 35%, how many years does she have to recover?"
- Use analogies: "Would you dress the same for summer beach and winter mountain? Different situations need different approaches."

### Classroom Management Issues

**Problem:** Students rushing through to finish first
**Solution:**
- Emphasize quality over speed: "This isn't a race. Accuracy and understanding matter."
- Add challenge questions for fast finishers
- Have them verify calculations with partner
- Require written justifications for portfolio choices (adds time)

**Problem:** Students copying from each other
**Solution:**
- Clarify that calculations should match (there's one right answer for metrics) but portfolio allocations might differ
- Ask students to explain their reasoning orally—can they defend choices?
- Emphasize personal risk tolerance is individual, not copyable

**Problem:** Off-task behavior during independent work
**Solution:**
- Circulate actively—presence keeps students focused
- Set checkpoint deadlines: "Activity 1 done by 10 minutes"
- Offer incentive: "First to complete accurately gets to share with class"
- Re-engage with questions: "How's it going? What have you discovered?"

**Facilitation Tips:**

1. **Let students discover:** Resist urge to tell them answers. Ask questions that lead them to conclusions.

2. **Celebrate honesty:** Students who admit low risk tolerance or fear of volatility are showing valuable self-awareness. Praise that.

3. **Connect to real life:** Constantly ask "How does this apply to YOUR situation? YOUR timeline? YOUR goals?"

4. **Normalize complexity:** Investing is genuinely complex. It's okay to say "This is sophisticated material—you're doing great."

5. **Share personal examples:** If appropriate, share your own investment approach and how you determined your risk tolerance.

6. **Emphasize long-term:** Combat short-term thinking. "You'll be investing for 50+ years. Today is just the start."

7. **Build confidence:** Students now have professional-level analytical tools. That's genuinely impressive.
