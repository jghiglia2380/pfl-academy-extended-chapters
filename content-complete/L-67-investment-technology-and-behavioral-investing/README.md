## Chapter Overview

**Title:** Investment Technology and Behavioral Investing

**Description:** A comprehensive exploration of modern investment technology platforms (robo-advisors, online brokerages, investment apps) and behavioral economics principles that affect investment decisions. Students learn to evaluate fintech tools, understand common investor biases (loss aversion, recency bias, confirmation bias, herd mentality), and develop strategies to make rational investment decisions despite psychological pitfalls.

**Learning Objectives:**
1. Evaluate different investment technology platforms including robo-advisors, investment apps, and online brokerages
2. Analyze how behavioral biases affect investment decisions and identify personal susceptibility to common errors
3. Compare the costs, benefits, and appropriate use cases for robo-advisors vs. DIY investing vs. financial advisors
4. Apply behavioral economics principles to create rules-based investment systems that counter emotional decision-making
5. Assess investment technology features and select appropriate tools aligned with personal financial goals and experience level

**Duration:** 2 days (55 minutes each)

**Template Format:** Standard
**Content Density:** Standard
**Day 1-Day 2 Connection:** Complementary (Day 1 teaches concepts, Day 2 applies them experientially)

## Developer Notes

### Technical Implementation Priorities

**High Priority (Must Build):**
1. Investment Platform Evaluator (primary skill builder, Day 1)
2. Behavioral Bias Self-Assessment (foundation for Day 2 activities)
3. Platform Comparison Worksheet PDF (backup for #1)

**Medium Priority (Strongly Recommended):**
4. Investment Decision Simulator (high engagement, experiential learning)
5. Bias-Counter Rules Builder (capstone activity, practical takeaway)
6. Behavioral Quiz PDF (backup for #2)

**Lower Priority (Nice-to-Have):**
7. Long-Term Cost Calculator (can use Excel spreadsheet temporarily)
8. Decision Scenarios PDF (backup for #4)
9. Rules Builder Worksheet PDF (backup for #5)

**All printable PDFs should be created** for accessibility compliance, but interactive tools provide superior learning experience.

### Data Maintenance Requirements

**Quarterly Updates (Every 3 Months):**
- Platform fees (Betterment, Wealthfront, Fidelity, Robinhood, Acorns, etc.)
- Platform features (new offerings, discontinued services)
- Minimum investment requirements
- Verify platform URLs still active

**Annual Updates:**
- Market return assumptions (verify 7% is reasonable)
- Platform availability (new platforms, mergers, closures)
- Behavioral research citations (new studies, updated statistics)
- Example scenarios (keep market references current)

**Semi-Annual Reviews:**
- Check for regulatory changes affecting platforms
- Update platform comparison matrix data
- Refresh real-world examples if needed
- Verify all external resource links functional

### Integration Specifications

**Tool-to-Tool Data Flow:**
- Behavioral Assessment results → Rules Builder (auto-import bias scores)
- Platform Evaluator → Decision Simulator (carry forward platform choices)
- Cost Calculator → Platform Evaluator (integrated comparison)
- All tools → Student Dashboard (save results, track progress)

**Platform Data Structure:**
```javascript
// Centralized platform database used by all tools
const platformDatabase = {
  betterment: {
    name: "Betterment",
    type: "robo-advisor",
    fees: { advisory: 0.0025, funds: 0.0008 },
    minimum: 0,
    features: { /* ... */ },
    url: "https://www.betterment.com",
    last_verified: "2025-11-13"
  },
  // ... all platforms
};
```

**API Considerations:**
- Consider fetching platform fees from live APIs (Betterment API, if available)
- Fallback to manual updates if APIs unavailable
- Cache data to prevent excessive API calls
- Notify admins when data is >3 months old

### Known Challenges

1. **Platform Data Currency:** Fees and features change frequently, requires maintenance
2. **Behavioral Quiz Validity:** Scoring algorithm should be validated with psychology experts
3. **Decision Simulator Complexity:** Branching scenarios require careful UX design
4. **Mobile Optimization:** Comparison matrices challenging on small screens
5. **Student Honesty:** Bias assessment only works if students answer honestly (not "correctly")

### Recommended Enhancements (Future Versions)

**Version 2.0 could include:**
- Real platform demos (embedded iframe walkthroughs)
- Video interviews with behavioral economists
- Peer comparison features (anonymous class averages)
- Gamified bias training mini-games
- Integration with real student investment accounts (when age-appropriate)
- Machine learning to refine bias scoring based on outcomes
- Community features (students share rules, rate effectiveness)
