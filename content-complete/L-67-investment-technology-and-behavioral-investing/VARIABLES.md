# L-67 State-Specific Variables

## Overview

**L-Chapter:** 67 - Investment Technology and Behavioral Investing
**State-Specificity Tier:** Tier 3 (Agnostic)
**Total Variables:** 0

This chapter contains **NO state-specific variables** because:

1. **Investment technology is national/international:** Robo-advisors, online brokerages, and investment apps operate across all states with identical features and fees
2. **Behavioral biases are human psychology:** Loss aversion, recency bias, confirmation bias, and herd mentality are hardwired into human brains regardless of geography
3. **Platform fees are universal:** Betterment charges 0.25% in California, Texas, and Vermont—fees don't vary by state
4. **Securities regulations are federal:** SEC and FINRA regulate investment platforms nationally, not state-by-state

## Universal Content Strategy

This chapter is designed to work identically for students in all 50 states because:

**Investment Platforms:**
- All platforms (Betterment, Fidelity, Robinhood, etc.) are accessible nationwide
- Fees, features, and minimums are the same regardless of location
- No state-level investment platform regulations affect student experience

**Behavioral Economics:**
- Psychological biases are human universal, not cultural or geographic
- Research cited (Kahneman, Tversky, Dalbar) applies to all investors
- Decision-making patterns transcend state boundaries

**Examples Used:**
- Character names and scenarios are deliberately generic (Keisha, Marcus, Jasmine)
- Dollar amounts realistic for any location ($5,000 initial, $200/month contributions)
- No references to specific cities, states, or local contexts
- Market scenarios (COVID crash, crypto bubbles) affected all states equally

## Why This Matters

**For Development Team:**
- No state data layer needed for L-67
- No annual state-specific updates required
- Single content version deploys to all states
- Testing complexity reduced (no state variations)

**For Content Maintenance:**
- Update platform fees quarterly (but same fees for all states)
- Update market examples annually (but same examples for all states)
- No per-state customization needed

**For Teachers:**
- No state-specific preparation required
- Content works identically in California, Texas, Vermont, Florida, etc.
- Can share lesson plans across state lines without modification

## Content That COULD Be State-Specific (But Isn't)

Some topics that might have state variations but don't affect this chapter:

**Not Relevant:**
- State tax treatment of investment gains (covered in other chapters)
- State-specific retirement programs (403(b), 457 plans)
- State securities regulations (Blue Sky Laws)
- State-specific investment incentives

**Why Not Included:**
This is an introductory chapter focused on:
1. Understanding platform types and choosing one
2. Recognizing behavioral biases in yourself
3. Creating rules to counter emotional decisions

Tax implications and advanced state-specific investing topics are covered in other chapters of the curriculum.

## Comparison to Other L-Chapters

**Tier 1 Chapters (Heavily State-Specific):**
- L-6: Understanding State Income Tax (varies dramatically by state)
- L-32: Home Buying Process (state-specific closing costs, regulations)
- L-46: Automobile Finance (state sales tax, registration fees, insurance)
- L-59: Local Tax Structures (60+ variables per state)

**Tier 2 Chapters (Benefits from State Examples):**
- L-10: Understanding Pay Stubs (state tax withholding varies)
- L-22: Renting vs. Buying (state rental laws, property taxes)

**Tier 3 Chapters (Fully Agnostic):**
- **L-67: Investment Technology and Behavioral Investing** (this chapter)
- L-47: Introduction to Investment Types (stocks, bonds, ETFs universal)
- L-48: Economics Basics (supply/demand applies everywhere)
- Most Standard 15 chapters (universal skills: resume writing, interviewing, etc.)

## Template Verification

**Variables Used:** None

**Template Syntax Check:**
- No `{{STATE_NAME}}` references ✓
- No `{{STATE_CODE}}` references ✓
- No `{{#if STATE_*}}` conditional logic ✓
- No state-specific calculations ✓
- No state resource URLs ✓

**Content Review:**
- All platform comparisons use national data ✓
- All examples work in any state ✓
- All scenarios are location-agnostic ✓
- No geographic references requiring customization ✓

## Future Considerations

**If State-Specific Content Added Later:**

Possible future enhancements that might require state variables:
1. State-sponsored retirement programs (CalSavers, OregonSaves, etc.)
   - Would require: `{{STATE_AUTO_IRA_PROGRAM}}`
2. State tax treatment of investment accounts
   - Would require: `{{STATE_CAPITAL_GAINS_TAX}}`
3. State-specific investment fraud protections
   - Would require: `{{STATE_SECURITIES_REGULATOR_URL}}`

**Current Decision:**
These topics are out of scope for L-67. This chapter focuses on platform selection and behavioral psychology, which are universally applicable. State-specific investment topics belong in advanced chapters.

## Quality Assurance

**Verification Questions:**

1. ✓ Can students in Vermont and Texas use the exact same content?
   - Yes—all platforms, fees, and biases are identical

2. ✓ Are all examples relatable regardless of location?
   - Yes—character backgrounds, dollar amounts, and scenarios are generic

3. ✓ Do teacher guides require state-specific preparation?
   - No—facilitation guidance is universal

4. ✓ Would adding state data improve educational value?
   - No—state variations don't affect core learning objectives

5. ✓ Is content future-proofed against state changes?
   - Yes—no state dependencies means no state-related maintenance

## Documentation Standards Met

✓ **Transparency:** Clearly documents that zero variables are used
✓ **Rationale:** Explains why chapter is state-agnostic
✓ **Comparison:** Shows how L-67 differs from state-specific chapters
✓ **Future-Proofing:** Identifies what might require variables later
✓ **Verification:** Confirms no template syntax present

---

## Summary

**L-67 uses ZERO state-specific variables** because investment technology platforms and behavioral psychology are universal across all states.

This is a **Tier 3 (fully agnostic)** chapter that works identically for students regardless of location.

**No state data layer required. No annual state updates needed. One content version for all 50 states.**
