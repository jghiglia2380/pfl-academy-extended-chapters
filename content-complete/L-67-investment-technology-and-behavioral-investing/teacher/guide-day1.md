# Teacher Guide - Day 1: Investment Technology and Behavioral Investing

## Lesson Overview

**L-Chapter:** L-67 - Investment Technology and Behavioral Investing
**Duration:** 55 minutes
**Format:** Direct instruction with interactive skill builder
**Focus:** Understanding investment technology platforms, behavioral biases in investing, and making rational investment decisions

This lesson introduces students to modern investment technology (robo-advisors, online brokerages, investment apps) and behavioral economics principles that affect investment decisions. Students learn to evaluate different platform types, understand common investor biases (loss aversion, recency bias, confirmation bias, herd mentality), and develop strategies to counter emotional decision-making. The lesson culminates with an interactive Investment Platform Evaluator where students compare platforms across different investor profiles.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

1. Evaluate different investment technology platforms including robo-advisors, investment apps, and online brokerages
2. Analyze how behavioral biases affect investment decisions and identify personal susceptibility to common errors
3. Compare the costs, benefits, and appropriate use cases for robo-advisors vs. DIY investing vs. financial advisors
4. Apply behavioral economics principles to create rules-based investment systems that counter emotional decision-making
5. Assess investment technology features and select appropriate tools aligned with personal financial goals and experience level

- Bookmark major platform websites for demonstration (Betterment, Fidelity, Robinhood)
- Have market crash scenario ready for behavioral bias demonstration

### Pre-Class Research
- Check current robo-advisor and brokerage fees (they change periodically)
- Identify recent market volatility examples for behavioral discussion
- Review recent investment app news (regulatory changes, new features)
- Prepare 1-2 examples of behavioral bias from recent financial news

### Important Context Notes
- This chapter is **Tier 3 (agnostic)** - no state-specific variables needed
- Focus on universal investing principles that apply anywhere
- Platforms and features are national/international (not state-dependent)
- Behavioral biases are human psychology (not geography-dependent)

## Detailed Lesson Plan

### Opening & Hook (5 minutes)

**[0:00-0:02] Attention Grabber:**

Display this scenario on the board:

> "You have $5,000 to invest for the first time. You open your phone and see dozens of investing apps: Robinhood, Acorns, Betterment, Wealthfront, M1 Finance, Public... Which one do you choose? Does it even matter?"

Ask students: "Turn to a partner—what would you look for in an investing app?"

Take 2-3 quick responses. Common answers: "Free," "Easy to use," "Popular," "Friends recommend it."

**[0:02-0:03] The Second Scenario:**

"Great. Now imagine you've been investing for 6 months. The market suddenly drops 15% in two weeks. Your $5,000 is now $4,250. What do you do?"

Ask for show of hands:
- Sell everything before it drops more? (many hands go up)
- Do nothing? (fewer hands)
- Buy more while it's cheap? (very few hands)

**[0:03-0:05] Frame the Lesson:**

"Today we're tackling two critical investing questions:
1. **WHAT to use:** How do you choose the right investment technology for your needs?
2. **HOW to think:** Why do our brains consistently make terrible investing decisions, and how do we stop that?

These two questions are connected. The right platform can help prevent behavioral mistakes. Understanding your psychological weaknesses helps you choose better tools. By the end of today, you'll be able to evaluate investment technology AND recognize when your brain is sabotaging your wealth building."

### Key Concepts (5 minutes)

**[0:05-0:10] Vocabulary Instruction:**

Organize terms into two categories on the board:

**TECHNOLOGY TERMS:**

1. **Robo-Advisor** - "Automated investing. Algorithms build and manage your portfolio."
   - Examples: Betterment, Wealthfront, Vanguard Digital Advisor
   - Typical fee: 0.25%-0.50% annually
   - Write on board: "Hands-off approach"

2. **Online Brokerage** - "You're the investor. Full control, you make all decisions."
   - Examples: Fidelity, Charles Schwab, E*TRADE
   - Commission-free stock/ETF trading now standard
   - Write on board: "DIY approach"

3. **Investment App** - "Mobile-first platforms. Simple, social, accessible."
   - Examples: Robinhood, Acorns, Stash, Public
   - Features: Fractional shares, round-ups, gamification
   - Write on board: "Beginner-friendly approach"

4. **Expense Ratio** - "Annual fee as a percentage of your investment."
   - Calculate on board: 0.10% on $10,000 = $10/year
   - "Lower is better—fees reduce your returns"

5. **Algorithmic Rebalancing** - "Automatic portfolio adjustments to maintain targets."
   - Example on board: "60% stocks grows to 70% → algorithm sells stocks, buys bonds to return to 60/40"

**BEHAVIORAL TERMS:**

6. **Behavioral Bias** - "Systematic errors in thinking that cause bad decisions."
   - Emphasize: "Even smart people have these. They're hardwired into human brains."

7. **Loss Aversion** - "Losses hurt twice as much as equal gains feel good."
   - Quick demo: "Lose $100 vs. Gain $100. Which affects you more emotionally?"

8. **Recency Bias** - "Overweighting recent events, assuming trends continue."
   - Example: "Market up for 5 years → must keep going up forever!"

9. **Confirmation Bias** - "Seeking only information that confirms what you already believe."
   - Example: "Love Tesla → only read positive Tesla news"

10. **Herd Mentality** - "Following what everyone else is doing."
    - Example: "Everyone's buying crypto → I should too!"

**Check for Understanding:**
"Which bias is at work when you panic sell during a market crash because everyone on Twitter is panicking? Turn to your neighbor."

Give 20 seconds, then confirm: Recency bias (recent drops feel permanent) + Herd mentality (following the crowd).

### Deeper Exploration (15 minutes)

**[0:10-0:17] Investment Technology Landscape (7 minutes):**

**Robo-Advisors (2 minutes):**

"Let's start with robo-advisors—the 'set it and forget it' option."

**How they work (demonstrate visually):**
1. You answer questions about goals, timeline, risk tolerance
2. Algorithm builds diversified portfolio (usually ETFs)
3. Automatic rebalancing maintains your allocation
4. Tax-loss harvesting on larger accounts

**On the board, create comparison:**
```
ROBO-ADVISORS
✓ Pros:
  - Professional management
  - Automatic rebalancing
  - No research needed
  - Prevents emotional mistakes

✗ Cons:
  - Annual fees (0.25%-0.50%)
  - Less control
  - Generic portfolios
  - Not for stock pickers

Best for: Hands-off investors who value automation
```

**Key insight:** "You're paying 0.25% for convenience AND behavioral protection. If it stops you from panic selling during crashes, that fee is worth it."

**Online Brokerages (2 minutes):**

"Next: Online brokerages—the 'I'll do it myself' option."

**On the board:**
```
ONLINE BROKERAGES
✓ Pros:
  - Full control
  - $0 commissions (stocks/ETFs)
  - Extensive research tools
  - Lowest total cost (if disciplined)

✗ Cons:
  - You make all decisions
  - No automatic rebalancing
  - Easier to overtrade
  - Requires knowledge/time

Best for: DIY investors who enjoy research, index fund investors
```

**Key insight:** "Cheapest option IF you can avoid behavioral mistakes. But if you panic sell or chase hot stocks, the 'savings' disappear fast."

**Investment Apps (2 minutes):**

"Finally: Investment apps—the 'make it easy' option."

**On the board:**
```
INVESTMENT APPS
✓ Pros:
  - Super simple interfaces
  - Micro-investing (start with $5)
  - Fractional shares
  - Social features

✗ Cons:
  - Subscription fees can be high (% on small balances)
  - Gamification can encourage overtrading
  - Limited research tools
  - May encourage risky behavior

Best for: Beginners starting small, passive micro-investors
```

**Critical warning:** "Some apps use gamification (confetti, celebrations) to make trading feel like a game. This can trigger addictive behavior and overtrading. Be aware of psychological manipulation."

**Cost Comparison Example (1 minute):**

Put this on the board:
```
$10,000 invested for 30 years at 7% return before fees:

Platform A (Robo at 0.40% total):
  Ending value: ~$70,000
  Fees paid: ~$14,000

Platform B (DIY at 0.08% total):
  Ending value: ~$74,000
  Fees paid: ~$3,000

Difference: $4,000 over 30 years
```

"Is $4,000 over 30 years worth having professional management and behavioral protection? That's personal. But you need to know what you're paying for."

**[0:17-0:25] Behavioral Biases Deep Dive (8 minutes):**

**Set up the importance (1 minute):**

"Here's the uncomfortable truth: Even with the perfect platform, most investors destroy their returns through behavioral mistakes. Studies show the average investor underperforms the market by 3-4 percentage points annually—almost entirely due to buying high and selling low."

"Let's understand the four major biases that cause this."

**Loss Aversion (2 minutes):**

"Research shows losing $100 causes about twice the pain as gaining $100 causes pleasure. This asymmetry wrecks portfolios."

**Demonstrate with scenario:**
```
You bought Stock A at $50. It's now $30.

Brain says: "Don't sell! That makes the loss REAL. Hold until it recovers."

Problem: The money is trapped in a losing investment instead of
working elsewhere. Meanwhile, you sell winners quickly to "lock in gains."

Result: You end up with a portfolio of losers.
```

"Studies show investors hold losing stocks 124 days but sell winners after 104 days. Exactly backward from optimal strategy."

**Recency Bias (2 minutes):**

"Our brains assume recent trends continue forever. This causes buying high and selling low."

**Scenario on board:**
```
Market up for 5 years → Feels like it will never go down
  → Investors pour money in near the peak → CRASH
  → "This decline will never end!" → Panic selling
  → Market recovers → Missed it

This cycle repeats every 7-10 years. Billions lost.
```

"The fix: Understand that markets are cyclical. Recent performance tells you almost nothing about future performance."

**Confirmation Bias (2 minutes):**

"Once you form an opinion, you seek only confirming evidence and dismiss contradictory information."

**Example:**
```
You love a stock → You read only positive articles
  → You follow only bulls on social media
  → Bad news? You dismiss it as "temporary"
  → Stock crashes → "How did I not see this coming?"

You saw it. You just ignored it.
```

**The fix:** "Actively seek disconfirming evidence. Ask: 'What would prove me wrong?' Force yourself to read bear cases."

**Herd Mentality (1 minute):**

"Fear of missing out (FOMO) and desire to conform drive herd behavior."

**Quick examples:**
- Dot-com bubble (1999-2000): "Everyone's getting rich in tech stocks!"
- Housing bubble (2006-2008): "Real estate only goes up!"
- Crypto mania (2021): "My Uber driver is buying Bitcoin!"
- Meme stocks (2021): "GameStop to the moon!"

"When your barber, Uber driver, and neighbor are all giving you investment tips, it's usually a sign the bubble is near its peak."

### Real-World Examples (10 minutes)

**[0:25-0:28] Example 1: Keisha's Robo-Advisor Journey (3 minutes):**

**Read scenario aloud:**

"Keisha, 24, just started her first professional job earning $48,000. She has $5,000 saved and can invest $200/month. She's overwhelmed by investment options."

**Put her choices on the board:**
```
Option A: Robinhood (pick stocks herself)
Option B: Betterment robo-advisor (0.25% fee)
Option C: Vanguard Target Fund (0.08% fee, DIY)
```

**Ask students:** "Which should she choose? Think about Keisha's situation—first job, overwhelmed, no research experience. Discuss with a partner for 30 seconds."

**Facilitate discussion:**
- Listen to 2-3 student recommendations
- Guide them to think about behavioral factors, not just fees
- Highlight: "Keisha's honest with herself—she'd likely chase performance and make emotional decisions on Robinhood."

**Reveal her choice:**

"Keisha chose Betterment. She set up automatic $200 monthly deposits. The automation ensured she kept investing during the 2022 market drop when friends panic-sold."

**Key lesson:** "After 5 years, she's paid ~$200 in fees but stayed invested through volatility. Friends who panic-sold lost WAY more than $200. The robo-advisor's behavioral protection was worth far more than the fee cost."

**[0:28-0:31] Example 2: Marcus and the Pandemic Panic (3 minutes):**

"Marcus, 28, started investing in 2019. By February 2020, his $15,000 had grown to $18,000. Then COVID-19 hit."

**Create timeline on board:**
```
Feb 2020: Portfolio = $18,000
Mar 2020: Markets crash 34% → Portfolio = $11,880
          (Lost $6,120 in 23 days)

Marcus's brain: "SELL EVERYTHING! Stop the bleeding!"
Friends are selling. News is apocalyptic. Hand hovers over "Sell All" button.
```

**Ask students:** "What should Marcus do? Vote with thumbs up (hold/buy more) or thumbs down (sell)."

**Count votes, then reveal:**

"Marcus remembered a rule he wrote when he started: 'Never sell based on short-term movements. Stick to the plan.'"

**Continue timeline:**
```
Mar-May 2020: Marcus keeps investing $300/month
              Buying stocks at 30% discounts
              Feels terrifying but rule keeps him disciplined

Aug 2020: Markets recover → Portfolio = $24,000
          Higher than before the crash!

Friends who sold in March: Locked in losses, missed recovery
```

**Key lesson:** "Marcus's understanding of behavioral biases—loss aversion, recency bias, herd mentality—saved him from a catastrophic mistake. His 60% gain from the March bottom would've been impossible without countering his biases."

**[0:31-0:35] Example 3: Jasmine's Confirmation Bias Trap (4 minutes):**

"Jasmine, 26, is passionate about sustainable energy. She invests $3,000 in a solar company stock at $45/share."

**Show how confirmation bias develops:**
```
Jasmine follows solar news obsessively
  → Joins solar investor Reddit
  → Follows solar CEO on Twitter
  → Every positive article reinforces her conviction

Stock drops from $45 to $38
  → She sees it as "buying opportunity"
  → Doesn't question the investment
```

**Warning signs she missed (put on board):**
- Declining profit margins (she focused on revenue growth)
- Major contract fell through (rationalized as "temporary")
- Competitors announced better tech (dismissed them)

**Ask students:** "What's the problem here? Turn to neighbor and identify the bias."

Give 20 seconds, confirm: Confirmation bias—she's seeking only positive information.

**The intervention:**

"Her friend asks: 'What would make you sell this stock?' Jasmine can't answer. She's stopped critically evaluating."

**Show her recovery:**
```
Forces herself to read critical analyses
  → Discovers company losing market share to competitors
  → Stock decline reflects real business problems

Decision: Sells half ($1,500) at $38 (takes $350 loss)
  → Reinvests in broad clean energy ETF (diversified)

Next year:
  - Her specific stock → drops to $25 (would've lost $1,200)
  - Clean energy ETF → rises 18%
```

**Key lesson:** "Confirmation bias made Jasmine a terrible judge of her own investment. Actively seeking disconfirming evidence—asking 'What would prove me wrong?'—protected her portfolio."

**Quick synthesis (1 minute):** "Notice the pattern: In all three examples, understanding psychology mattered MORE than choosing the perfect platform or investment. Behavioral awareness is your superpower."

### Reflection Prompt (3 minutes)

**[0:35-0:38] Individual Reflection:**

Display on board:
```
PERSONAL REFLECTION (write answers):

1. Which behavioral bias are you MOST susceptible to?
   Loss aversion / Recency bias / Confirmation bias / Herd mentality
   Why do you think that?

2. When markets drop 20%, would you more likely:
   Panic sell / Hold steady / Buy more
   What about your personality makes you think that?

3. Which platform approach suits you best right now?
   Robo-advisor / Online brokerage / Investment app
   Why?

4. What rule could you establish NOW to prevent emotional
   decisions during market volatility?
```

"Take 3 minutes. Be honest—this is for YOU, not for a grade. Understanding your psychology NOW, before you have real money invested, is the most valuable thing you can do."

**Circulate:** Monitor that students are writing thoughtfully. If someone finishes quickly, ask: "Can you think of a real example from your life where this bias affected a decision?"

### Skill Builder Activity (12 minutes)

**[0:38-0:40] Introduce the Tool (2 minutes):**

"Now you'll use our Investment Platform Evaluator to compare platforms for different investor profiles."

**Demonstrate quickly:**
1. "Select an investor profile from the dropdown"
2. "The tool shows platform options with costs, features, suitability scores"
3. "Compare costs over 10 and 30 years"
4. "Make a recommendation and explain why"

**Show one example (Beginner with $500):**
- "Acorns charges $3/month. On $500, that's 7.2% annually—WAY too expensive."
- "Better choice: Betterment or Fidelity Go with no minimum, percentage-based fee."
- "Notice how suitability changes based on account size."

**[0:40-0:50] Student Work Time (10 minutes):**

**Instructions on board:**
```
EVALUATE 3 DIFFERENT PROFILES:
□ Beginner with $500
□ DIY Enthusiast with $10,000
□ Busy Professional with $50,000
□ Experienced Investor with $100,000

For each:
1. Compare total costs over 10 and 30 years
2. Evaluate feature trade-offs
3. Choose best platform and explain why
4. Note 1 insight about how circumstances affect choice
```

**Your role during work time:**

**Circulate and coach:**
- "What surprised you about the cost differences?"
- "Why did you choose that platform for this profile?"
- "How would the recommendation change if they had 10× more money?"

**Watch for common issues:**

| Issue | Coaching Response |
|-------|-------------------|
| Choosing only by lowest fee | "Is the cheapest option always best? What about behavioral protection?" |
| Not considering features | "Look at the features column—what does this investor actually need?" |
| Ignoring suitability scores | "The tool calculates fit based on profile. Why is it recommending this one?" |
| Rushing through scenarios | "Slow down. Calculate the 30-year cost difference. Is it $500 or $50,000?" |

**For advanced students:**
- "Can you identify which behavioral bias each platform type helps prevent?"
- "Design a platform for someone highly susceptible to FOMO and overtrading."

**For struggling students:**
- "Start with the Beginner profile. Just compare two platforms: Betterment vs. Robinhood."
- "Look at the monthly cost. Which is more affordable for someone with $500?"

### Summary & Closing (5 minutes)

**[0:50-0:53] Recap Key Points (3 minutes):**

**Ask students to share insights:**
"In 10 seconds or less, share one thing you learned today."

Take 4-5 rapid responses.

**Synthesize on board:**
```
KEY TAKEAWAYS:

Technology:
✓ Robo-advisors = automation + behavioral protection (worth modest fee)
✓ Online brokerages = lowest cost IF you're disciplined
✓ Investment apps = accessible but watch for fees and manipulation
✓ Platform choice matters, but psychology matters MORE

Behavioral:
✓ Everyone has biases—even experts
✓ Loss aversion → holding losers, selling winners
✓ Recency bias → buying high, selling low
✓ Confirmation bias → ignoring warning signs
✓ Herd mentality → following crowd into bubbles
✓ FIX: Recognize biases, establish rules, automate behavior
```

**[0:53-0:55] Preview Day 2 (2 minutes):**

"Tomorrow's Learning Lab is 90% hands-on. You'll:
1. Do deep comparisons of real platforms with current data
2. Take a behavioral bias self-assessment—discover YOUR biggest risks
3. Run investment decision simulations—experience how biases affect choices in real time
4. Build your personal bias-counter system—rules to protect you when emotions run high
5. See how fees compound over 40 years—the numbers will shock you

Come ready to work. This isn't lecture—this is you figuring out YOUR investment psychology and YOUR platform preferences. See you tomorrow!"

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Advanced Students
**Enrichment Activities:**
1. Research factor investing and smart beta strategies offered by robo-advisors
2. Compare robo-advisor tax-loss harvesting effectiveness across platforms
3. Analyze historical behavioral bias examples (dot-com, housing, crypto bubbles)
4. Design an "anti-bias" investment platform—what features would counter psychology?
5. Calculate breakeven account size where robo-advisor fees become worthwhile

**Discussion Prompts:**
- "Why do passive index investors often outperform active stock pickers despite doing less?"
- "How might AI/machine learning change robo-advisor capabilities in the next 10 years?"
- "What psychological tricks do investment apps use, and are they ethical?"

### For Struggling Students
**Scaffolding:**
1. Provide simplified comparison matrix with only 2 platforms (Betterment vs. Fidelity)
2. Use pre-calculated examples to reduce math burden
3. Focus on one behavioral bias at a time with clear examples
4. Pair with stronger student for peer explanation
5. Provide sentence frames: "Platform X is better for [investor type] because..."

**Simplified Content:**
- Skip advanced features (tax-loss harvesting, factor investing)
- Focus on basic cost comparison: "Which costs less per year?"
- Use only whole number percentages (avoid decimals)
- Emphasize personal examples: "Have you ever followed a trend everyone was doing?"

### For English Language Learners (ELL)
**Language Support:**
1. Pre-teach vocabulary with visual aids (especially financial terms)
2. Provide bilingual glossary of key terms
3. Use more visuals, less text in examples
4. Allow extra processing time for reflection questions
5. Pair with bilingual peer when possible

**Simplified Language:**
- "Robo-advisor = robot that invests for you"
- "Bias = when your brain tricks you into bad decisions"
- "Fees = money you pay the company every year"
- Use shorter sentences and active voice

### For Diverse Learning Needs
**Visual Learners:**
- Use color-coded platform comparison charts
- Create visual flowcharts for decision-making
- Show pie charts of cost breakdowns
- Use infographics for behavioral bias examples

**Kinesthetic Learners:**
- Use physical movement: "Stand up if you'd sell during a crash, sit if you'd hold"
- Manipulatives: Paper slips with platform features to physically sort
- Role-play investor scenarios with decision points

**Auditory Learners:**
- Think-pair-share discussions for each concept
- Podcast episode recommendations on behavioral investing
- Verbal explanation of platform comparisons

## Common Misconceptions and Challenges

### Misconception 1: "Free investing apps are always the best choice"
**Why it's wrong:** "Free" often means payment for order flow (worse execution prices), limited research tools, and potentially manipulative gamification.

**How to address:** Show total cost comparison including hidden costs. Explain: "Free apps make money somehow—understand how before assuming they're better."

### Misconception 2: "If I'm smart, I won't fall for behavioral biases"
**Why it's wrong:** Behavioral biases affect everyone, including professional investors and PhDs. Intelligence doesn't protect you.

**How to address:** Share examples of smart people (even Nobel Prize winners) making behavioral mistakes. Emphasize: "It's not about intelligence—it's about human psychology. Everyone needs systems."

### Misconception 3: "Robo-advisors are too expensive compared to DIY"
**Why it's wrong:** 0.25% fee is small compared to the cost of behavioral mistakes (panic selling, overtrading, chasing performance).

**How to address:** Calculate: "If robo-advisor prevents one panic-sell during a crash, it saves you way more than 0.25% annually. Behavioral protection has huge value."

### Misconception 4: "I should pick the platform my friends use"
**Why it's wrong:** Different investors have different needs. Your friend's perfect platform might be terrible for you.

**How to address:** "Would you wear your friend's prescription glasses? No—you need what fits YOUR vision. Same with investment platforms."

### Misconception 5: "Watching the market closely makes you a better investor"
**Why it's wrong:** Frequent checking increases emotional reactions and poor decisions. Time in the market beats timing the market.

**How to address:** Share research showing investors who check accounts daily underperform those who check quarterly. "Ignorance is sometimes bliss in investing."

### Misconception 6: "You can avoid losses by selling before crashes"
**Why it's wrong:** No one can consistently predict crashes. Attempts to time the market usually result in missing recoveries.

**How to address:** Show historical data: Missing the 10 best market days over 30 years cuts returns by 50%. "The best days often come right after the worst days."

## Assessment Opportunities

### Formative Assessment

**During Key Concepts (5 min):**
- Quick calculation check: "What's 0.25% of $10,000?" → Answers should be $25
- Bias identification: "Which bias is causing you to sell winners quickly?" → Loss aversion
- Platform matching: "Which platform suits hands-off investors?" → Robo-advisors

**During Real-World Examples (10 min):**
- Ask prediction questions: "What do you think Keisha should choose?"
- Observe partner discussions for understanding
- Listen for correct use of vocabulary terms

**During Skill Builder (12 min):**
- Check recommendations make sense for investor profiles
- Verify students can calculate and compare costs
- Ask students to explain their reasoning verbally

**Exit ticket idea:**
"In 2-3 sentences: Which behavioral bias are you most worried about affecting YOUR investing, and what's one rule you could establish to counter it?"

### Summative Assessment

**Day 2 Activities serve as performance assessment:**
- Platform comparison demonstrates evaluation skills
- Behavioral quiz assesses self-awareness
- Decision simulator tests application of concepts
- Rules builder shows ability to create systems

**Potential Quiz Questions:**
1. Calculate total annual cost of Platform A (0.25% advisory fee + 0.10% ETF fees) on $15,000
2. Match behavioral biases to scenarios
3. Recommend platform for given investor profile with justification
4. Identify which bias is at work in a given scenario
5. Explain why fees matter more over 30 years than 3 months

**Project Idea:**
"Create a personalized investment plan including: (1) platform choice with justification, (2) your top 3 behavioral risks, (3) specific rules to counter each bias, (4) 30-year cost projection."

## Teacher Reflection

After teaching this lesson, consider:
