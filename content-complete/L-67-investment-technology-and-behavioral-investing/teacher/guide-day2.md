# Teacher Guide - Day 2: Investment Technology and Behavioral Investing Learning Lab

## Learning Lab Overview

**L-Chapter:** L-67 - Investment Technology and Behavioral Investing
**Duration:** 55 minutes
**Format:** 90% hands-on activities, 10% facilitation/reflection
**Teacher Role:** Coach and facilitator, not lecturer

Today's Learning Lab is student-driven and activity-based. Students will work through five interactive stations that apply yesterday's concepts to real-world platform selection and behavioral bias recognition. Your primary role is to circulate, ask probing questions, troubleshoot issues, and help students make connections to their own investing psychology. Resist the temptation to lecture—let the activities teach.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this Learning Lab, students will be able to:

1. Compare real investment platforms in detail and recommend appropriate choices for specific investor profiles
2. Identify their own behavioral bias susceptibilities through self-assessment and scenario analysis
3. Experience how behavioral biases affect decision-making in realistic market simulations
4. Create personal rules-based systems to counter emotional investing decisions
5. Calculate and visualize the long-term compounding impact of investment fees

"Questions about logistics? No? Begin with Activity 1."

### Activity 1: Platform Deep Dive Comparison (15 minutes)

**[0:05-0:20] Facilitation Approach:**

**Your Role:** Circulate and coach. Don't tell students which platform is "best"—guide them to analyze for themselves.

**What to Look For:**
- Are students using the comparison matrix effectively?
- Do they understand the trade-offs between features and costs?
- Are they calculating 30-year costs correctly?
- Can they articulate WHY one platform suits a profile better?
- Are they considering behavioral factors, not just fees?

**Coaching Questions to Ask:**

*When students are comparing platforms:*
- "What's the annual cost difference between these two platforms?"
- "Which features matter most for this investor profile?"
- "How much is automation worth to someone who doesn't enjoy investing?"
- "What would happen to costs if the account grew to $100,000?"

*When students make a choice:*
- "Why did you choose that platform for this scenario?"
- "What's your second choice? How close was the decision?"
- "Would your answer change if this person was susceptible to panic selling?"
- "How did you weigh cost vs. features vs. ease of use?"

*For struggling students:*
- "Start by just comparing two platforms: Betterment and Fidelity."
- "Look at the annual fee column. Which costs less for someone with $3,000?"
- "Now look at features. Does the cheaper one do everything this investor needs?"

*For advanced students:*
- "Calculate the breakeven account size where the robo-advisor fee equals the value of your time to manage it yourself."
- "Which platform would you choose if this person is highly susceptible to overtrading?"
- "How would tax-loss harvesting value change the cost-benefit analysis?"

**Common Issues & Solutions:**

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "All the fees look the same to me" | "Calculate in dollars, not percentages. On $10,000: 0.25% = $25/year, 0.05% = $5/year. Over 30 years?" |
| Choosing only by lowest cost | "Is the cheapest car always the best car? What about features, reliability, fit for your needs?" |
| Ignoring behavioral factors | "If this platform prevents one panic sell, how much does it save compared to the fee?" |
| Rushing through calculations | "Slow down. Use the calculator. Show me the 30-year total cost difference." |
| Tool not loading | Use printable comparison worksheet as backup |

**Key Insights to Highlight:**

When you hear good student observations, amplify them:
- "Great insight! Sarah noticed that subscription fees are expensive on small balances but reasonable on large ones."
- "Exactly! Marcus identified that DIY is cheapest IF you can avoid behavioral mistakes."
- "That's the key trade-off: Pay for convenience and discipline, or save money if you can provide your own discipline."

### Activity 2: Behavioral Bias Self-Assessment (12 minutes)

**[0:20-0:32] Facilitation Approach:**

**Your Role:** Help students interpret results honestly and without judgment. This is self-discovery, not a grade.

**What to Look For:**
- Are students taking the quiz seriously (not rushing)?
- Do they understand what each bias means?
- Can they connect quiz results to real examples from their lives?
- Are they being honest or answering how they "should" answer?

**Coaching Questions to Ask:**

*After students complete quiz:*
- "Which bias scored highest for you? Surprised or expected?"
- "Can you think of a real example where this bias affected a decision you made?"
- "Look at the suggested antidote—does that strategy make sense for you?"
- "If you were designing an investment platform for yourself, what features would counter your #1 bias?"

*When students review results:*
- "Why do you think loss aversion scored high for you?"
- "Have you ever held onto something (not just money) too long because you didn't want to admit it was a mistake?"
- "When your friends are all excited about something, are you more likely to join in or step back?"

*For students who scored low on everything:*
- "Interesting—you might be less susceptible than average, or you might not be fully aware of your biases yet."
- "Try this: Think about the last trend everyone was following. Did you want to join in?"
- "Remember, everyone has biases. They're hardwired. It's not a weakness—it's being human."

*For students who scored high on multiple biases:*
- "Don't worry—everyone has multiple biases. The key is knowing yours."
- "Which one do you think would hurt your investing most?"
- "What's the ONE rule that would protect you from your biggest risk?"

**Common Issues & Solutions:**

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "I don't have any biases" | "Everyone does—they're psychological, not personal flaws. The quiz helps identify which ones affect you most." |
| Answering "correctly" not honestly | "This isn't graded. The only person you hurt by being dishonest is yourself. Real self-awareness is the goal." |
| Not understanding scenarios | "Let me explain this one: You bought Stock A at $100, it's now $70..." (walk through step-by-step) |
| Dismissing results | "These biases cost investors millions. Even Nobel Prize winners have them. Take this seriously." |
| Quiz not scoring correctly | Use printable version and score manually using answer key |

**Key Teaching Moments:**

- **Normalize biases:** "Raise your hand if you scored high on loss aversion. See? It's the most common bias—our brains evolved this way."
- **Connect to yesterday:** "Remember Marcus from yesterday? His high recency bias almost made him panic sell. Knowing it helped him resist."
- **Emphasize systems:** "You can't eliminate biases, but you can build systems to work around them. That's what successful investors do."

**Red Flags to Address:**

- Student seems distressed by results → "These are tendencies, not destinies. Awareness is the first step to controlling them."
- Student is cavalier about results → "This matters. Behavioral biases are the #1 reason investors underperform. Take it seriously."
- Students comparing scores competitively → "This isn't a competition. Different biases, different risks. Focus on YOUR results."

### Activity 3: Investment Decision Simulator (18 minutes)

**[0:32-0:50] Facilitation Approach:**

**Your Role:** Let students make decisions without interference, then debrief to connect decisions to biases.

**What to Look For:**
- Are students thinking through decisions or clicking randomly?
- Do they change strategies between scenarios?
- Can they identify which biases influenced their choices?
- Are they learning from outcomes or just moving through?

**Scenario A: The Market Crash (6 minutes)**

**As students work:**

*Watch for panic selling:*
- Mental note of students who sell after Month 1 or 2
- Prepare to discuss: "What bias drove that decision?"

*Watch for steady holding or buying:*
- Note students who stay invested or buy more
- Ask: "What made you able to hold steady when it's scary?"

**After scenario completion (2 min group discussion):**

"Okay, quick poll:
- Who sold everything in Month 1? (show hands)
- Who held steady? (show hands)
- Who bought more? (show hands)

Those who sold: What were you feeling? (Take 2-3 answers: fear, panic, wanting to stop the loss)
That's loss aversion and recency bias. Your brain saying 'make the pain stop' and 'this decline will never end.'

Those who held or bought: What helped you resist selling? (Take 2-3 answers: rules, remembering lessons, long-term thinking)

Now look at the outcomes. The market recovered by Month 12. What happened to your portfolios based on your decisions?"

**Key teaching point:** "The winning strategy felt TERRIBLE while you were doing it. That's why behavioral investing is hard—the right choice often feels wrong."

**Scenario B: The Hot Stock (6 minutes)**

**As students work:**

*Watch for FOMO decisions:*
- Note how much students allocate to the "hot" investment
- Prepare to discuss herd mentality and recency bias

**After scenario completion (2 min discussion):**

"Poll: How much did you invest in the hot crypto?
- 0% (stick to plan)
- 5% (small bet)
- 20%+ (significant allocation)

For those who invested a lot: What was the reasoning? (Answers: don't want to miss out, everyone's making money, seems like easy gains)

That's herd mentality plus FOMO. Your friend made 300%, so it feels like easy money.

Now look at historical outcomes. What happened to most 'hot' investments after everyone piled in?"

**Key teaching point:** "When your barber, Uber driver, and friend are all giving you the same investment tip, it's usually near the peak. Herd mentality drives bubbles."

**Scenario C: The Confirmation Trap (6 minutes)**

**As students work:**

*Watch for holding vs. selling decisions:*
- Note students who double down (confirmation bias strong)
- Note students who sell or diversify (able to admit mistakes)

**After scenario completion (2 min discussion):**

"This one's hard because the company might recover OR it might keep falling. The key isn't the outcome—it's your PROCESS.

Did you:
- Ignore the negative news and focus only on the positive article? → Confirmation bias
- Look at whether business fundamentals changed or just the price? → Rational analysis
- Sell immediately to stop the pain? → Loss aversion
- Hold just because selling = admitting mistake? → Loss aversion again

The right answer depends on whether the business is actually broken or just the price dropped. But confirmation bias prevents you from seeing reality clearly."

**Coaching Questions Throughout:**

*During scenarios:*
- "What are you feeling right now as you make this decision?"
- "Which bias do you think is influencing you?"
- "If this were a friend's portfolio instead of yours, would you give different advice?"

*After scenarios:*
- "What surprised you about your decisions?"
- "Which scenario was hardest emotionally?"
- "Did knowing about biases help you make better choices, or did you still fall into traps?"
- "What rule would have protected you from your worst decision?"

**Common Issues & Solutions:**

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Treating it like a game | "This is practice for real money. Take it seriously. How would you feel if this were $50,000?" |
| Not reading scenarios carefully | "Slow down. Read the news headlines. They give you important information." |
| Choosing same strategy each time | "Try varying your approach. See what happens with different strategies." |
| Simulator not loading | Use paper-based scenario cards with branching decision trees as backup |

### Activity 4: Build Your Bias-Counter System (7 minutes)

**[0:50-0:52] Facilitation Approach:**

**Your Role:** Ensure rules are specific, actionable, and personalized—not generic platitudes.

**What to Look For:**
- Are rules specific ("I will...") not vague ("Try to...")?
- Do rules directly address student's #1 bias from self-assessment?
- Are rules actionable (student can actually follow them)?
- Has student identified accountability mechanisms?

**Coaching Questions to Ask:**

*As students create rules:*
- "How will you know if you're following this rule?"
- "Is 'I'll try not to panic' specific enough, or do you need 'I will wait 48 hours before selling during any market drop'?"
- "What will remind you to follow this rule when emotions are high?"
- "Who can you share this rule with for accountability?"

*Testing specificity:*
- "Your rule says 'invest regularly.' How much and how often specifically?"
- "You say 'don't check portfolio too much.' Define 'too much'—daily? Weekly? Monthly?"
- "What's the EXACT trigger for this rule? When do you apply it?"

**Examples of GOOD vs. VAGUE rules:**

| Vague Rule | Specific Rule |
|------------|---------------|
| "Stay calm during crashes" | "I will not sell during any market drop less than 30% without waiting 7 days" |
| "Invest regularly" | "I will invest $200 on the 1st of every month regardless of market conditions" |
| "Don't follow trends" | "I will not invest in anything I learned about from social media for 72 hours minimum" |
| "Think long-term" | "I will review my written investment plan before making ANY change to my portfolio" |

**For each rule, ensure:**
1. **Specific trigger:** When does this rule apply?
2. **Specific action:** What exactly will you do?
3. **Specific constraint:** What prevents you from breaking it?

**Common Issues & Solutions:**

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Rules too vague | "Make it specific. Instead of 'be patient,' try 'wait 48 hours before acting on any sell urge.'" |
| Too many rules | "Pick your top 3. The ones that address YOUR biggest risks from the quiz." |
| Rules they won't follow | "Be realistic. Will you actually do this? If not, revise it to something you will do." |
| Not addressing real biases | "Look at your quiz results. Your #1 bias was [X]. Does this rule protect you from that?" |
| No accountability | "Who will you share these with? How will you track whether you follow them?" |

**[0:52-0:55] Pair Share (3 minutes):**

"Find a partner. Share your top 3 rules. Partner: Ask 'Why this rule? How will it help you?'"

**Listen for:** Students explaining their psychological reasoning. If you hear good examples, share with class.

### Activity 5: Long-Term Cost Visualization (Integrated)

**[Integrated into Activity 1]**

This brief activity is built into the Platform Comparison Tool. As students compare platforms, ensure they:

1. Calculate 30-year costs, not just annual fees
2. See the compounding impact visualized
3. Understand the trade-off: fees vs. behavioral protection

**If students haven't engaged with this, prompt:**
- "Click on the '30-year projection' tab. What do you see?"
- "Compare Platform A and Platform B over 30 years. How big is the difference?"
- "Is that difference worth it for automatic management and behavioral protection?"

## Reflection & Wrap-Up (3 minutes)

**[0:52-0:55] Harvest Key Insights:**

**Rapid reflection (1 minute):**

Display on board:
```
Write ONE sentence for each:

1. Platform choice: Which type will you likely use when you start investing?
2. Biggest behavioral risk: Which bias worries you most?
3. Your #1 rule: What rule will protect you?
```

**Share out (2 minutes):**

"Who's willing to share their #1 rule?"

Take 4-5 volunteers. Listen for variety:
- Rules about regular investing
- Rules about not panic selling
- Rules about avoiding FOMO
- Rules about checking accounts less frequently

**Synthesize:**

"Notice the patterns: The best rules are SPECIFIC, they address YOUR personal biases, and they create systems that make good behavior automatic.

Remember:
✓ Platform choice matters, but psychology matters more
✓ Everyone has biases—successful investors just recognize and counter them
✓ Rules beat willpower—decide now, before emotions are high
✓ Start investing soon with whatever platform fits your current knowledge level
✓ The best time to establish good habits is BEFORE you have serious money at stake

Tomorrow: [Preview next lesson or remind about assessments]"

- [ ] Rules are realistic (student will actually follow them)

### Formative Assessment Questions:

**Verbal checks during circulation:**
- "Explain why you chose Platform X for this investor."
- "Which bias from your quiz is at work in this scenario?"
- "How does this rule protect you from your #1 bias?"
- "Calculate the 30-year cost difference between these two platforms."

**Observation checklist:**
- Student engages thoughtfully with tools (not rushing)
- Student calculations are accurate
- Student reasoning shows understanding of concepts
- Student makes personal connections (not just academic exercise)

### Red Flags to Address:

**Behavioral Red Flags:**
- Student dismisses biases as "not applicable to me" → Everyone has biases; awareness is key
- Student treats activities like game (not serious) → Connect to real money implications
- Student copies partner's answers without thinking → Encourage independent analysis first
- Student gets frustrated with "wrong" answers → There's often no single right answer; reasoning matters

**Content Red Flags:**
- Student can't calculate percentages correctly → Provide calculator, simplify numbers
- Student doesn't understand platform differences → Go back to basics: robo vs. DIY vs. app
- Student makes illogical platform recommendations → Ask probing questions to reveal thinking
- Student creates vague, unactionable rules → Work one-on-one to add specificity

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Advanced Students

**Challenge Extensions:**
1. Calculate breakeven account size where robo-advisor fees equal value of time saved
2. Design an "ideal" platform that counters all behavioral biases—what features would it have?
3. Research factor investing and smart beta—how do they differ from traditional indexing?
4. Analyze a historical bubble (dot-com, housing, crypto) through behavioral bias lens
5. Create a detailed investment policy statement with specific rules for all scenarios

**Additional Tasks:**
- Compare tax-loss harvesting value across different robo-advisors
- Build Excel model showing fee compounding over 40 years with different return assumptions
- Research payment for order flow and analyze true cost of "free" trading
- Investigate how robo-advisor algorithms actually work (modern portfolio theory)

### For Struggling Students

**Scaffolding:**
1. Simplify platform comparison to just TWO options (Betterment vs. Fidelity)
2. Provide pre-calculated examples to reduce math burden
3. Focus on ONE behavioral bias at a time with clear examples
4. Give sentence frames: "I chose Platform X because ___"
5. Pair with stronger student for peer support

**Simplified Activities:**
- Skip advanced features (tax-loss harvesting, factor investing)
- Use simpler scenarios in decision simulator
- Provide rule templates to modify rather than create from scratch
- Focus on basic cost comparison: "Which costs less per year?"

**Alternative Assessment:**
- Verbal explanation instead of written
- Multiple choice instead of open-ended
- Match platform to investor profile (given options)
- Identify bias in scenario (given definitions)

### For English Language Learners (ELL)

**Language Support:**
1. Pre-teach key vocabulary with visual aids
2. Provide bilingual glossary of financial terms
3. Use more visuals, less text in explanations
4. Allow extra processing time for reading scenarios
5. Pair with bilingual peer when possible

**Simplified Language:**
- "Robo-advisor = robot invests for you automatically"
- "Bias = when your brain tricks you into bad choice"
- "Fee = money you pay the company every year"
- Use shorter sentences and active voice

**Visual Aids:**
- Color-coded platform comparison charts
- Icon-based bias explanations
- Flowcharts for decision-making
- Infographics instead of text-heavy examples

### For Diverse Learning Styles

**Visual Learners:**
- Emphasize charts, graphs, and visualizations in tools
- Use color-coding for different platforms and biases
- Provide visual decision flowcharts
- Show video examples of behavioral biases

**Kinesthetic Learners:**
- Use movement: Stand up for different bias responses
- Physical sorting of platform features (cards)
- Role-play investor scenarios with partners
- Use manipulatives for portfolio allocation

**Auditory Learners:**
- Encourage think-pair-share throughout
- Verbal explanation of choices to partner
- Listen to podcast clips about behavioral investing
- Record verbal reflections instead of written

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Technology Issues

| Problem | Quick Fix | Backup Plan |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Platform Evaluator won't load | Clear browser cache, try different browser | Use printable comparison worksheet |
| Behavioral quiz not scoring | Refresh page, check internet connection | Use paper quiz with manual scoring |
| Decision simulator freezing | Restart browser, check for updates | Use scenario cards with written decision points |
| Cost calculator errors | Verify inputs are valid numbers | Use Excel template or calculator |
| Multiple students locked out | Check server status, contact IT | Switch to offline PDF activities |

### Content Confusion

| Confusion | Root Cause | Solution |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| "All platforms seem the same" | Not seeing trade-offs | Focus on specific use case: "Which for hands-off investor?" |
| "I don't have biases" | Lack of self-awareness | Use concrete examples: "Have you ever held onto something bad too long?" |
| Can't calculate fees | Math struggle | Provide calculator, simplify to round numbers |
| Don't understand robo-advisor | Too abstract | Demo actual platform interface (Betterment.com) |
| Overwhelmed by choices | Too many options | Narrow to 2-3 platforms maximum |

### Behavioral/Engagement Issues

| Issue | Likely Cause | Intervention |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| Student rushing through | Wants to finish, not learn | "Slow down. Quality over speed. Did you really answer the reflection questions?" |
| Student off-task | Doesn't see relevance | "This matters for YOUR money someday. Take it seriously." |
| Student copying partner | Easier than thinking | "I need to see YOUR analysis. Work independently first, then discuss." |
| Student frustrated | Struggling with content | Check in privately, offer simplified version or partner support |
| Student disengaged | Bored or lost | Ask: "Where are you stuck?" or "What would make this more interesting?" |

## Extension & Enrichment

### For Students Who Finish Early

**Additional Explorations:**
1. Research three platforms not in the comparison tool—how do they compare?
2. Create a presentation recommending a platform for a specific investor profile
3. Find a recent news article about behavioral bias in action—analyze it
4. Design a quiz question to test classmates on behavioral biases
5. Build a more sophisticated cost comparison spreadsheet with variable returns

**Real-World Applications:**

1. Download and explore 2-3 investing apps—compare interfaces
2. Read one chapter from *The Psychology of Money* by Morgan Housel
3. Watch "The Big Short" and identify behavioral biases
4. Listen to podcast episode on behavioral economics
5. Create a detailed personal investment plan (platform, biases, rules)

## Post-Class Teacher Reflection

After the Learning Lab, consider:

**Engagement:**
- Were students actively engaged, or did activities feel like busywork?
- Which activity generated the most discussion and insight?
- Did students make personal connections or stay purely academic?
- What modifications would increase engagement next time?

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Can students clearly explain platform trade-offs?
- Do students show awareness of their own biases?
- Are student-created rules specific and actionable?
- Did students grasp the long-term impact of fees?

**Timing:**
- Were estimates accurate, or did students need more/less time?
- Which activity could be shortened or extended?
- Did students rush or feel pressured for time?
- Should activity order change?

**Differentiation:**
- Did scaffolding support struggling students effectively?
- Were advanced students challenged appropriately?
- Did ELL students have necessary language support?
- What adjustments are needed for my class makeup?

**Technology:**
- Did all tools work smoothly?
- Were there technical issues that disrupted learning?
- Do students need better tech orientation beforehand?
- Are backup plans sufficient?

**Next Steps:**
- What follow-up is needed to reinforce concepts?
- Should I add real-world examples from current events?
- Do students need more practice with calculations?
- How can I connect this to upcoming lessons?

---

**Note:** This is a Tier 3 (agnostic) chapter with universal application. No state-specific customization needed—behavioral biases and investment platforms are the same regardless of student location.
