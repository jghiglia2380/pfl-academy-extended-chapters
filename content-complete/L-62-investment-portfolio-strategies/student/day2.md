## Learning Lab Activities

### Activity 1: Lifecycle Portfolio Construction
**Time:** 15 minutes

Build three portfolios representing different life stages, each optimized for its specific circumstances.

**Part A: Young Professional Portfolio (Age 25, 40-year horizon) - 5 min**

**Scenario:** Recent graduate, stable job earning $48,000, can invest $400/month, no dependents, high risk capacity

**Your Tasks:**
1. Determine target allocation (___% stocks, ___% bonds, ___% other)
2. Justify allocation based on:
   - Time horizon (40 years = can weather volatility)
   - Risk capacity (young, stable income, long recovery time)
   - Goals (maximize growth for retirement)

3. Select specific investments (choose 3-5):
   - Total U.S. Stock Market ETF: ___% (allocation)
   - International Stock ETF: ___%
   - Total Bond Market ETF: ___%
   - Other: ___% (specify)

4. Calculate projected 40-year value:
   - Monthly contribution: $400
   - Assumed annual return based on allocation: ___%
   - Projected retirement balance: $_________

**Checkpoint:** Does your allocation make sense for someone with 40 years until retirement? Too conservative risks missing growth; too aggressive beyond what's prudent is unnecessary.

**Part B: Mid-Career Portfolio (Age 45, 20-year horizon) - 5 min**

**Scenario:** Established career earning $95,000, has $180,000 already saved, can invest $800/month, two children, moderate risk capacity

**Your Tasks:**
1. Determine target allocation (___% stocks, ___% bonds, ___% other)
2. Justify allocation considering:
   - Shorter time horizon than young professional
   - Significant wealth accumulated (more to protect)
   - Still needs growth for 20+ year retirement
   - Moderate risk tolerance

3. Select specific investments (3-5 funds)
4. Calculate projected 20-year growth:
   - Starting balance: $180,000
   - Monthly contribution: $800
   - Assumed annual return: ___%
   - Projected age-65 balance: $_________

**Part C: Pre-Retirement Portfolio (Age 60, 5-year horizon) - 5 min**

**Scenario:** Planning to retire at 65, has $550,000 saved, investing $1,200/month, needs stability but also 25-year retirement funding

**Your Tasks:**
1. Determine target allocation (___% stocks, ___% bonds, ___% cash)
2. Balance competing needs:
   - Near-term stability (retiring in 5 years)
   - Long-term growth (25-year retirement)
   - Sequence-of-returns risk (early retirement losses devastating)

3. Select specific investments emphasizing stability
4. Project 5-year growth:
   - Starting: $550,000
   - Monthly: $1,200
   - Return: ___%
   - Age-65 balance: $_________

**Synthesis:** How did your allocations change across life stages? What pattern emerges about stocks vs. bonds as time horizons shorten?

### Activity 2: Historical Scenario Testing
**Time:** 12 minutes

Test your three portfolios through actual historical market events to understand resilience and behavior.

**Scenario 1: 2008 Financial Crisis (4 min)**

Historical Performance:
- U.S. Stocks: -37%
- International Stocks: -45%
- U.S. Bonds: +5%
- Cash: +2%

For each of your three portfolios, calculate:

**Young Professional (90/10 stocks/bonds):**
- Portfolio return: ___% (weighted average)
- Dollar loss on $52,000 portfolio: $_________
- Recovery time (at historical rates): ___ years
- Emotional response: Could you stay invested through this?

**Mid-Career (70/30 stocks/bonds):**
- Portfolio return: ___%
- Dollar loss on $220,000 portfolio: $_________
- Recovery time: ___ years
- Impact on goals: Would you still reach retirement target?

**Pre-Retirement (50/50 stocks/bonds):**
- Portfolio return: ___%
- Dollar loss on $570,000 portfolio: $_________
- Recovery time: ___ years
- Risk assessment: Could you retire on schedule or need to delay?

**Key Insight:** Notice how allocation dramatically affected losses. This is why age-appropriate allocation matters—a 60-year-old can't afford the same losses as a 25-year-old.

**Scenario 2: 2020 COVID Crisis and Recovery (4 min)**

March 2020:
- Stocks: -34% (crash)
- Bonds: +3% (flight to safety)

Rest of 2020:
- Stocks: +68% from bottom (ending year +18% overall)
- Bonds: +7% for year

Calculate for each portfolio:
- Losses at market bottom (March)
- Year-end results
- Importance of staying invested (panic sellers locked in 34% loss; holders ended up +18%)

**Scenario 3: 1970s Stagflation (4 min)**

10-year period (1970-1979):
- Stocks: ~35% total return (3.5% annualized—below inflation)
- Bonds: ~50% total return (5% annualized—below inflation)
- Inflation: 7.1% annual average
- Real returns: Negative for both stocks and bonds

**Analysis:**
- How would each portfolio fare?
- Importance of continuing contributions (buying at depressed prices)
- Why young investors can benefit from poor markets (accumulating shares cheaply)
- Why near-retirees need caution (can't recover from decade of poor returns)

**Reflection:** Which historical scenario would be hardest for you psychologically? Does this inform your actual risk tolerance?

### Activity 3: Rebalancing Simulation
**Time:** 10 minutes

Experience how rebalancing maintains allocation and potentially improves returns.

**Setup:** Start with $50,000 portfolio, 80% stocks ($40,000) / 20% bonds ($10,000)

**Year 1:**
- Stocks return +25% → $50,000 (was $40,000)
- Bonds return +4% → $10,400 (was $10,000)
- Portfolio now: $60,400 total (83% stocks / 17% bonds) ← DRIFTED

**Your Action:**
- [ ] Rebalance: Sell $1,720 stocks, buy $1,720 bonds to restore 80/20
- [ ] Don't rebalance: Let it ride

**Year 2:**
- Stocks return +12%
- Bonds return +3%

**Calculate both scenarios:**

*If you rebalanced:*
- Stocks (80% = $48,320): grow 12% → $___
- Bonds (20% = $12,080): grow 3% → $___
- Total: $___

*If you didn't rebalance:*
- Stocks (83% = $50,000): grow 12% → $___
- Bonds (17% = $10,400): grow 3% → $___
- Total: $___

**Year 3:** Stocks return -8%, Bonds return +5%

**Calculate both scenarios again...**

**Years 4-5:** Continue through provided return sequences

**Final Comparison (after 5 years):**
- Rebalanced portfolio value: $___
- Non-rebalanced portfolio value: $___
- Difference: $___
- Allocation drift without rebalancing: ___% stocks / ___% bonds

**Key Insights:**
- Rebalancing forced selling stocks after big gains (Year 1) → bought bonds cheap
- When stocks fell (Year 3), rebalanced portfolio had less stock exposure
- Rebalancing enforced "buy low, sell high" systematically
- Non-rebalanced portfolio took on more risk than intended (drifted to 87% stocks)

**Challenge Question:** Over decades, rebalancing typically adds 0.5-0.8% annually. On a $500,000 portfolio over 20 years, this equals $___,___ in additional wealth from discipline alone.

### Activity 4: Tax Optimization Strategy
**Time:** 12 minutes

Learn to minimize taxes through strategic asset location and account structure.

**Scenario:** You have $200,000 to invest:
- $100,000 in taxable brokerage account
- $100,000 in traditional IRA (tax-deferred)
- Target: 60% stocks / 40% bonds overall

**Strategy A: Same allocation in both accounts**
- Taxable: 60% stocks ($60k), 40% bonds ($40k)
- IRA: 60% stocks ($60k), 40% bonds ($40k)

**Strategy B: Tax-optimized location**
- Taxable: 100% stocks ($100k) - only long-term capital gains
- IRA: 20% stocks ($20k), 80% bonds ($80k) - high-income bonds sheltered

**Strategy C: Moderate optimization**
- Taxable: 80% stocks ($80k), 20% bonds ($20k)
- IRA: 40% stocks ($40k), 60% bonds ($60k)

**Calculate 20-year after-tax outcomes:**

Assumptions:
- Stocks return 10% annually (mostly capital gains)
- Bonds return 5% annually (all taxable interest)
- Tax bracket: 24% on ordinary income, 15% on long-term capital gains
- Stocks in taxable account: only pay taxes when sold (year 20)
- Bonds: taxed annually on interest

**Strategy A (No optimization):**
- Taxable account bonds generate $2,000 annual interest
- Annual tax on bond interest: $480 (24% × $2,000)
- 20-year cumulative taxes: $___,___
- Net after-tax value: $___,___

**Strategy B (Full optimization):**
- Taxable account: no annual taxes (capital gains deferred)
- IRA bonds: grow tax-deferred (tax at withdrawal, not modeled)
- 20-year cumulative taxes: $___,___
- Net after-tax value: $___,___
- **Tax savings vs. Strategy A: $___,___**

**Strategy C:**
- Moderate annual taxes
- 20-year cumulative: $___,___
- Net value: $___,___

**Analysis:**
- Which strategy left you with the most after-tax wealth?
- How much did optimal asset location add over 20 years?
- Why does this matter even more with larger portfolios?

**Practical Application:**
Given your anticipated account types (401k, IRA, taxable):
1. Which accounts should hold bonds? (Tax-advantaged)
2. Which should hold stocks? (Can be either, but taxable OK)
3. Which should hold REITs or high-dividend stocks? (Tax-advantaged)

- The most surprising insight from historical scenario testing

## Key Takeaways

1. **Asset Allocation Dominates Performance:** Your stock/bond split matters far more than specific fund selection. Over 90% of portfolio variance comes from allocation, not security selection. Match allocation to time horizon and risk tolerance.

2. **Lifecycle Allocation Evolves:** Appropriate allocation changes as you age and circumstances change. Young investors can accept volatility for growth; near-retirees need stability. Plan gradual transitions, not sudden shifts.

3. **Rebalancing Enforces Discipline:** Systematic rebalancing forces buying low and selling high, opposite of emotional impulses. Annual or threshold-based rebalancing maintains intended risk while potentially improving returns modestly.

4. **Tax Efficiency Compounds:** Strategic asset location, minimizing turnover, and tax-loss harvesting can add 0.5-1.5% annually after taxes. Over decades, this becomes massive wealth differences—hundreds of thousands on large portfolios.

5. **Written Plan Beats Emotion:** Investors with formal investment policy statements—documented allocations, rebalancing rules, and triggers—dramatically outperform those making ad-hoc decisions. Your plan should be boring and systematic, not exciting and reactive.

**Next Steps:** Implement your investment policy statement. Open necessary accounts if you haven't. Set up automatic contributions. Schedule your annual rebalancing. Most importantly: stay the course through volatility. Time and discipline matter more than perfect optimization.

**Before Next Class:** If you have existing investments, analyze your current allocation. Does it match your goals and risk tolerance? If starting fresh, research the specific funds you selected and consider opening an account. Come prepared to discuss any questions about implementing your portfolio strategy.
