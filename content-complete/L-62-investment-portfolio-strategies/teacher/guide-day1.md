# L-62: Investment Portfolio Strategies - Teacher Guide (Day 1)

## Lesson Overview
**Duration:** 55 minutes | **Focus:** Asset allocation, diversification, rebalancing, tax efficiency

This lesson advances from L-47's investment types foundation to strategic portfolio construction and management. Students learn how to combine investments effectively, not just understand them individually.

## Learning Objectives
1. Design appropriate asset allocations based on age, goals, and risk tolerance
2. Implement effective diversification strategies
3. Apply rebalancing techniques
4. Evaluate tax-efficient strategies
5. Create comprehensive investment portfolios

## Key Teaching Points

### Asset Allocation is Primary Driver
**Critical Concept:** Asset allocation (stock/bond split) explains >90% of portfolio performance variance.

**Teaching Moment:** Show two investors:
- Investor A: Perfectly picks individual stocks, but 50/50 allocation
- Investor B: Uses index funds, but 80/20 allocation
- Over 30 years, B's allocation decision matters far more than A's stock-picking

### Time Horizon Determines Appropriate Risk
Use lifecycle examples:
- Age 25, 40-year horizon → 80-90% stocks justified
- Age 60, 5-year horizon → 50-60% stocks more appropriate
- Same person, different life stages = different allocations

### Rebalancing Is Counterintuitive
Students resist "selling winners" and "buying losers"

**Reframe:** "You're not selling winners—you're taking profits from overvalued assets and buying undervalued ones. That's smart."

**Math Demonstration:** Show 5-year simulation where rebalancing adds 0.7% annually = $140,000 over career

### Tax Efficiency Is "Found Money"
Many students don't realize taxes consume 1-2% annually if not managed

**Dramatic Reveal:** "$500,000 portfolio over 30 years: poor tax strategy costs $240,000 in unnecessary taxes. That's 10 years of contributions wasted."

## Differentiation

**Advanced:**
- Calculate efficient frontier for optimal risk/return
- Research international diversification benefits
- Analyze factor investing (value, momentum, quality)

**Struggling:**
- Focus on age-based rules only ("110 - age = stock %")
- Use pre-built target-date funds instead of custom portfolios
- Simplify to 3-fund portfolio (U.S. stocks, international, bonds)

**ELL:**
- Visual portfolio pie charts
- Bilingual investment terminology
- Simplified allocation decision trees

## Common Misconceptions

1. **"More diversification is always better"**
   - Reality: Over-diversification adds complexity without benefit

2. **"Rebalancing means missing gains on winners"**
   - Reality: Rebalancing controls risk while often improving returns

3. **"Young people don't need bonds"**
   - Reality: Even small bond allocation reduces volatility significantly

4. **"I'll time the market—sell before crashes, buy before recoveries"**
   - Reality: Impossible to do consistently; staying invested beats timing

## State-Specific Customization
No significant state customization needed (universal investment concepts). Optional: mention state-specific 529 plans or retirement programs if relevant.

## Assessment
- Exit ticket: "What allocation is appropriate for a 30-year-old saving for retirement? Justify."
- Portfolio design project (Day 2)
- Rebalancing simulation results

## Connections
**Builds directly on:** L-47 (Investment Types)
**Prepares for:** L-63 (Advanced Investment Concepts)
**Connects to:** L-19 (Retirement Planning - 401k/IRA invest in portfolios)

**Teacher Reflection:** Focus on making abstract concepts concrete through examples and simulations. Students often intellectually understand but emotionally resist (especially rebalancing and accepting volatility). Repeated exposure to historical data helps build confidence.
