# L-62: Investment Portfolio Strategies - Teacher Guide (Day 2 Learning Lab)

## Learning Lab Overview
**Duration:** 55 minutes | **Format:** Hands-on portfolio construction and testing

Students build portfolios for three life stages, test through historical scenarios, implement rebalancing, optimize taxes, and create personal investment policy statements.

## Facilitation Strategy

### Activity 1: Lifecycle Portfolios (15 min)
**Key Coaching Points:**
- Young professional (age 25): Look for 80-90% stocks—anything below 70% is probably too conservative
- Mid-career (age 45): 70-75% stocks balances growth with some protection
- Pre-retirement (age 60): 50-60% stocks maintains growth for long retirement while providing stability

**Common Student Errors:**
- Making young portfolio too conservative (50% stocks)
- Making pre-retirement portfolio too aggressive (80% stocks)

**Intervention:** Ask "What's the consequence of this allocation if [market scenario]?"

### Activity 2: Historical Scenarios (12 min)
**Critical Teaching Moment:** 2008 Crisis
- 90% stock portfolio lost 33%
- 50% stock portfolio lost 16%
- This is WHY age-appropriate allocation matters

**Student Reactions:**
- Some will say "I'd sell" after seeing losses
- **Response:** "And miss the 2009-2020 bull market? Worst decision. Historical data shows staying invested always wins long-term."

**Highlight:** 2020 panic sellers locked in 34% loss; holders ended year +18%. Timing markets is impossible.

### Activity 3: Rebalancing (10 min)
**Make It Visceral:**
"After 5 years, rebalanced portfolio has $68,200, non-rebalanced has $67,100. That's $1,100 from 20 minutes of annual rebalancing—$5,500/hour wage for portfolio maintenance!"

**Watch For:** Students who don't understand the math
- **Solution:** Walk through Year 1 rebalancing step-by-step on board

### Activity 4: Tax Optimization (12 min)
**Dramatic Reveal:**
- Strategy A (no optimization): $242,000 after-tax after 20 years
- Strategy B (optimized): $267,000 after-tax
- **$25,000 from simply putting right investments in right accounts!**

**Common Confusion:** Why bonds in IRA?
- **Explain:** Bonds generate annual taxable interest. Sheltering that in IRA saves taxes every year. Stocks mostly grow through capital gains you can defer, so taxable account works fine.

### Activity 5: Investment Policy Statement (11 min)
**Emphasize:** This is THE most important activity
- Written plans dramatically improve investment outcomes
- Prevents emotional decisions during volatility

**Quality Check:** Circulate and verify:
- Allocations total 100%
- Allocations match time horizon (not too aggressive or conservative)
- Rebalancing schedule is specific (not "sometime")
- Student selected actual funds (not generic "stocks")

## Red Flags to Address

**Student Overconfidence:** "I'll just pick winning stocks"
- **Reality Check:** "Professional fund managers with decades of experience, research teams, and Bloomberg terminals can't consistently beat index funds. What makes you think you can?"

**Student Paralysis:** "This is too complicated; I'll never invest"
- **Simplify:** "Three-fund portfolio. Total stock market, total international, total bond market. That's it. Done. Anyone can do this."

**Student Risk Denial:** "I can handle any loss"
- **Challenge:** "Your $50,000 becomes $30,000. Do you sell or buy more? Be honest." Most don't truly know their risk tolerance until tested.

## Assessment & Monitoring

**Strong Understanding:**
- Allocations logically progress: aggressive → moderate → conservative with age
- Justifications reference time horizon and risk capacity
- Rebalancing math is correct
- Tax optimization shows understanding of account types

**Struggling:**
- Same allocation for all three ages
- Can't explain why they chose allocation
- Math errors in projections
- Doesn't see value in tax optimization

**Intervention:** Provide allocation decision tree flowchart. Guide through time horizon → risk capacity → allocation recommendation.

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Advanced Portfolio Builder tool not loading
**Solution:** Use printable worksheets with manual calculations. Projections: FV = P(1+r)^n formula.

**Problem:** Students finishing at very different rates
**Solution:** Early finishers: design portfolio for grandparent or parent. Slow workers: complete Activities 1-3 only; 4-5 become homework.

**Problem:** Students resistant to homework that involves real account opening
**Solution:** Clarify it's RESEARCH only (look at account types, minimums, available funds). Not requiring them to invest real money.

## State-Specific Notes
Universal content. No state customization required beyond optional mention of state 529 plans.

## Teacher Reflection
After class:
- Did students grasp why allocation matters more than security selection?
- Did rebalancing simulation convince them of value?
- Were historical scenarios effective in demonstrating risk?
- Did students create realistic, implementable investment policy statements?

**Key Success Metric:** Students leave with specific, written investment plans they can actually execute, not just theoretical knowledge.
