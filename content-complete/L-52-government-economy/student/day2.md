# L-52: Government and the Economy - Personal Impact
## Day 2: Policy Analysis and Personal Impact - Learning Lab

### Learning Objectives
By the end of today's Learning Lab, you will be able to:
- Apply cost-benefit analysis to evaluate government policies
- Assess how {{STATE_NAME}} and federal policies affect your personal finances
- Analyze specific regulations and their impact on prices and choices
- Develop informed opinions on government's appropriate economic role

---

## Opening Reflection (5 minutes)

**Write:** Think about three ways government affects your daily life (regulations, taxes, services, etc.)

**Questions:**
- Which government policies/services do you rely on?
- Which policies cost you money or limit your choices?
- Overall, does government help or hurt your personal finances?

Keep these in mind as we analyze policies today.

## Learning Lab Activities

### Activity 1: {{STATE_NAME}} Policy Impact Analysis (20 minutes)

**Objective:** Analyze how specific {{STATE_NAME}} policies affect your personal finances

#### Part A: Tax Burden Analysis (8 minutes)

**Calculate your total tax burden from a hypothetical income:**

**Scenario:** You earn $40,000/year in {{STATE_NAME}}

**Federal Taxes:**
| Tax Type | Rate/Amount | Annual Cost |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Federal income tax | ~12% bracket | ~$3,000 |
| Social Security | 6.2% | $2,480 |
| Medicare | 1.45% | $580 |
| **Federal Total** | | **~$6,060** |

**{{STATE_NAME}} Taxes:**
| Tax Type | Rate/Amount | Annual Cost |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| State income tax | {{STATE_TAX_STRUCTURE}} | $_______ |
| Sales tax (assume $10k spending) | __% | $_______ |
| Property tax (if own home) | Varies | $_______ |
| Gas tax (assume 500 gal/yr) | $__/gal | $_______ |
| Other state/local taxes | | $_______ |
| **{{STATE_NAME}} Total** | | **$_______** |

**Total Tax Burden:** $_______ = _____% of income

**Analysis Questions:**

1. **What do you get for these taxes?**
   - Federal: National defense, Social Security, Medicare, roads, courts
   - {{STATE_NAME}}: Schools, police/fire, roads, parks, universities
   - List 5 services you use: _______________________

2. **Are you getting good value?**
   - Do benefits exceed costs?
   - Are there wasteful programs?
   - What would you cut? What would you expand?

3. **How does {{STATE_NAME}} compare to other states?**
   - High-tax states: CA, NY, NJ (more services but higher costs)
   - Low-tax states: TX, FL, TN (fewer services but lower costs)
   - Would you rather live in high-tax or low-tax state? Why?

#### Part B: Government Services You Use (7 minutes)

**Estimate the value of government services you consume:**

| Service | Provider | Approximate Value if You Had to Pay |
|---------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| **Public school** (K-12) | {{STATE_NAME}} | $12,000/year × 13 years = $156,000 |
| **Police protection** | Local | $__ /year (what would private security cost?) |
| **Fire protection** | Local | $__ /year |
| **Roads/highways** | {{STATE_NAME}}/Federal | $__ /year (tolls you'd pay?) |
| **Parks and libraries** | Local/{{STATE_NAME}} | $__ /year |
| **Public university subsidy** (if applicable) | {{STATE_NAME}} | $__ /year (vs. private tuition) |
| **Other:** _______________ | | $__ /year |
| **TOTAL VALUE** | | **$_______** |

**Compare to taxes paid:** $_______ (taxes) vs. $_______ (services value)

**Are you a net recipient or net contributor?**
- Most young people are net recipients (use schools, haven't paid lifetime of taxes yet)
- As you age and earn more, you become net contributor
- This is intergenerational transfer

#### Part C: Regulation Impact (5 minutes)

**How do {{STATE_NAME}} regulations affect prices and choices?**

| Regulation | Purpose | Your Cost | Your Benefit |
|-----------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Occupational licensing** (doctors, electricians, etc.) | Quality control | Higher prices (limited supply) | Safety, guaranteed competence |
| **Emissions testing** (vehicles) | Reduce pollution | $__ fee + repairs | Cleaner air |
| **Building codes** | Safety | Higher construction costs | Safe buildings |
| **Minimum wage** {{STATE_MIN_WAGE}} | Higher worker pay | Higher prices at businesses | If you earn minimum wage: higher income |
| **Zoning laws** | Organized development | Limited housing supply = higher rent/prices | Neighborhood character |

**Analysis:**
- Which regulations provide good value (benefits > costs)?
- Which are excessive (costs > benefits)?
- Which should {{STATE_NAME}} change?

### Activity 2: Policy Cost-Benefit Analysis (15 minutes)

**Objective:** Systematically evaluate proposed policies

**Choose ONE policy to analyze:**

☐ Raise {{STATE_NAME}} minimum wage to $15/hour
☐ Make public community college free in {{STATE_NAME}}
☐ Implement statewide carbon tax
☐ Ban single-use plastic bags in {{STATE_NAME}}
☐ Increase gas tax by $0.10/gallon for infrastructure
☐ Require paid family leave for all employers

**Your Policy:** _______________________

#### Cost-Benefit Framework

**STEP 1: Identify the Problem**
- What market failure or issue does this policy address?
- _______________________________________________________

**STEP 2: Benefits**

| Stakeholder | How They Benefit | Estimated Value |
|-------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Group 1: ____________ | | $__ or (describe) |
| Group 2: ____________ | | $__ or (describe) |
| Group 3: ____________ | | $__ or (describe) |
| Society overall | | |

**STEP 3: Costs**

| Stakeholder | How They're Harmed | Estimated Cost |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Group 1: ____________ | | $__ or (describe) |
| Group 2: ____________ | | $__ or (describe) |
| Group 3: ____________ | | $__ or (describe) |
| Society overall | | |

**STEP 4: Unintended Consequences**
- What might happen that policymakers didn't anticipate?
- Example: Minimum wage increase → automation, reduced hours
- Your policy's unintended consequences: _______________________

**STEP 5: Alternatives**
- Is there a better way to solve the problem?
- Market-based solution? Different regulation? Do nothing?
- Alternatives: _______________________

**STEP 6: Your Recommendation**

☐ **Implement** - Benefits clearly exceed costs
☐ **Modify** - Good idea but needs changes: _______________________
☐ **Reject** - Costs exceed benefits or better alternatives exist

**Reasoning:** _______________________________________________________

**How confident are you? (1-10):** _____

**What information would increase your confidence?** _______________________

#### Example: Minimum Wage Increase to $15/hour

**Problem:** Low-wage workers struggle to afford living expenses

**Benefits:**
- Low-wage workers: +$5,000-$10,000/year income (1-2M workers in typical state)
- Reduced poverty, less reliance on welfare
- More consumer spending (multiplier effect)

**Costs:**
- Small businesses: Higher labor costs, may reduce hiring, raise prices, or close
- Consumers: Higher prices (estimates: 1-4% increase in affected sectors)
- Some workers: Lose jobs or hours due to automation/cutbacks (estimates: 0-3% employment loss)

**Unintended Consequences:**
- Faster automation (kiosks replace cashiers)
- Businesses move to states with lower minimum wage
- Reduced entry-level opportunities for teens

**Alternatives:**
- Expand Earned Income Tax Credit (subsidizes low-wage workers without affecting employment)
- Local minimum wages (vary by cost of living)
- Gradual increase with inflation indexing

**Verdict:** Debated! Economists disagree on whether benefits exceed costs.

### Activity 3: Regulation Deep Dive (10 minutes)

**Objective:** Analyze a specific {{STATE_NAME}} regulation in detail

**Select one regulation:**

☐ {{STATE_NAME}} occupational licensing (choose: cosmetology, contractors, etc.)
☐ {{STATE_NAME}} environmental regulations
☐ {{STATE_NAME}} rent control (if applicable)
☐ {{STATE_NAME}} certificate of need laws (healthcare)
☐ {{STATE_NAME}} zoning and land use regulations

**Your regulation:** _______________________

#### Analysis Template

**1. What does the regulation require?**
- _______________________________________________________

**2. What problem was it intended to solve?**
- _______________________________________________________

**3. Does it solve that problem?**
- ☐ Yes ☐ Partially ☐ No
- Evidence: _______________________

**4. What are the costs?**

**To consumers:**
- Higher prices? Limited choices? Reduced quality?
- _______________________________________________________

**To businesses:**
- Compliance costs? Barriers to entry? Competitive disadvantage?
- _______________________________________________________

**To society:**
- Deadweight loss? Inefficiency? Unintended consequences?
- _______________________________________________________

**5. Who benefits?**
- _______________________________________________________

**6. Who's harmed?**
- _______________________________________________________

**7. Your verdict:**

☐ **Keep as-is** - Benefits clearly exceed costs
☐ **Reform** - Good intent but needs improvement: _______________________
☐ **Repeal** - Costs exceed benefits, eliminate

**Evidence supporting your position:** _______________________

#### Example: Cosmetology Licensing in {{STATE_NAME}}

**Requirements:**
- 1,500 hours of training (9-12 months)
- Licensing exam
- Fees: $5,000-15,000 for training

**Problem it solves:**
- Ensure hair stylists know sanitation, safety
- Protect consumers from harm

**Does it solve problem?**
- Partially: Basic safety could be taught in 100 hours
- Excessive: 1,500 hours is more than EMT training (150 hrs)

**Costs:**
- **Consumers:** Higher prices (licensed stylists charge more to recoup training costs)
- **Aspiring stylists:** Barrier to entry, especially for low-income individuals
- **Competition:** Reduces supply, entrenches existing stylists

**Benefits:**
- Basic safety standards
- Professional legitimacy

**Who benefits most?**
- Existing licensed stylists (reduced competition)

**Verdict:** Reform - Reduce hours to reasonable safety standard (300 hrs?), eliminate unnecessary requirements

## Closing Activity: Your Political Economy Philosophy (5 minutes)

**Based on today's analysis, where do you fall on the spectrum?**

```
More Market ←——————————————→ More Government
(Less intervention)      (More intervention)

Libertarian → Conservative → Moderate → Progressive → Socialist
```

**Mark your position: X**

**Your philosophy:**

**1. When should government intervene in markets?**
- ☐ Rarely (only for property rights, courts, defense)
- ☐ Sometimes (clear market failures only)
- ☐ Often (market failures plus equity concerns)
- ☐ Extensively (markets often fail, government usually better)

**2. Which is bigger problem?**
- ☐ Too much government (high taxes, excessive regulation, inefficiency)
- ☐ Too little government (market failures, inequality, exploitation)
- ☐ Balanced / depends on specific issue

**3. What's your priority?**
- ☐ Economic freedom and growth (even if some inequality)
- ☐ Economic security and equity (even if some efficiency loss)
- ☐ Balance both

**4. {{STATE_NAME}}-specific:**
- Should {{STATE_NAME}} have more, less, or same level of:
  - Taxes: ☐ More ☐ Less ☐ Same

  - Social services: ☐ More ☐ Less ☐ Same

**5. Your biggest insight from today:**
- _______________________________________________________

**Important:** Your political philosophy may change as you learn more. These are complex issues without easy answers. Smart citizens:

## Summary & Key Takeaways

### What We Applied Today:

✓ **Tax burden analysis** - Understanding what you pay and what you get

✓ **Cost-benefit framework** - Systematic policy evaluation weighing winners vs. losers

✓ **Regulation analysis** - Examining specific {{STATE_NAME}} regulations for effectiveness

✓ **Personal impact assessment** - How policies affect YOUR finances and choices

✓ **Critical thinking** - Developing informed opinions based on evidence, not just emotion or ideology

### Connecting Concepts:

**From L-48-51:**
- Market economy + government = mixed economy (L-48)
- Monopolies justify regulation (L-51)
- Supply/demand shifted by taxes/subsidies (L-50)
- Incentives drive behavior - policies change incentives (L-49)

**From L-52:**
- Market failures sometimes justify intervention
- But intervention has costs and risks
- Smart policy requires weighing trade-offs
- {{STATE_NAME}} policies directly affect your finances

**Key Integration:**
Government's role is debated because there are real trade-offs. Neither pure markets nor extensive government is clearly superior - the optimal mix depends on:
- Specific circumstances
- Values (freedom vs. security, growth vs. equality)
- Effectiveness of government institutions
- Severity of market failures
