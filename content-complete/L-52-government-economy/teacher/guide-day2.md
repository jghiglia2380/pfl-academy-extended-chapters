## Detailed Facilitation Guide

### Opening Reflection (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Students connect government policies to their daily lives

**Facilitation Steps:**

1. **Display prompt:** "Think about three ways government affects your daily life (regulations, taxes, services, etc.)"

2. **Set timer for 3 minutes silent writing**

3. **Questions on board:**
   - Which government policies/services do you rely on?
   - Which policies cost you money or limit your choices?
   - Overall, does government help or hurt your personal finances?

4. **DO NOT share publicly** - This is personal reflection

5. **Transition:** "Keep these in mind as we analyze policies today. By the end, you'll have frameworks to evaluate government's impact systematically."

**Key Teaching Point:**
"Most of us have gut feelings about government (too big, too small, just right). Today we'll move beyond feelings to DATA-DRIVEN analysis."

---

### Activity 1: {{STATE_NAME}} Policy Impact Analysis (20 minutes)

**Objective:** Calculate actual tax burden and government services value

---

#### Part A: Tax Burden Analysis (8 minutes)

**Facilitation:**

1. **Introduction (1 minute):**
   - "You'll calculate total tax burden from hypothetical $40,000 income"
   - "This is eye-opening - most people don't realize how much they pay"

2. **Federal Taxes - Walk Through Together (2 minutes):**

Display on board:
```
$40,000 income:
- Federal income tax: ~$3,000 (12% bracket)
- Social Security: $2,480 (6.2%)
- Medicare: $580 (1.45%)
- TOTAL FEDERAL: ~$6,060 (15.2%)
```

3. **{{STATE_NAME}} Taxes - Students Calculate (5 minutes):**

**Provide {{STATE_NAME}} data:**
- State income tax: [{{STATE_NAME}} specific rate structure]
- Sales tax: [{{STATE_NAME}} rate]
- Property tax: [typical amount or rate]
- Gas tax: [{{STATE_NAME}} rate per gallon]

**Example for state with 5% flat income tax:**
```
$40,000 income:
- State income tax: $2,000 (5% flat)
- Sales tax on $10k spending: $500 (5%)
- Gas tax (500 gal × $0.30): $150
- TOTAL STATE: ~$2,650 (6.6%)
```

**Total Tax Burden: ~$8,710 = 21.8% of income**

4. **Analysis Questions (2 minutes):**

Students answer individually:
- "What do you get for these taxes?"
- "Are you getting good value?"
- "How does {{STATE_NAME}} compare to other states?"

**Coaching Points:**
- "High-tax states (CA, NY, NJ): More services but higher costs"
- "Low-tax states (TX, FL, TN): Fewer services but lower costs"
- "There's no 'right' answer - depends on what you value"

**Common Student Reactions:**
- "That's so much!" → "Yes, but think about what you get..."
- "I didn't know I paid that much" → "Most people don't - it's hidden in withholding"
- "Can I move to low-tax state?" → "Sure, but you'll get fewer services"

---

#### Part B: Government Services You Use (7 minutes)

**Facilitation:**

1. **Introduction (1 minute):**
   - "Now estimate value of services you RECEIVE"
   - "If you had to pay privately, what would these cost?"

2. **Walk Through Example (2 minutes):**

Display on board:
```
Public school K-12: $12,000/year × 13 years = $156,000
Police protection: $300/year (vs. private security)
Fire protection: $100/year
Roads: $500/year (tolls you'd pay)
Parks/libraries: $100/year
```

3. **Students Calculate (3 minutes):**
   - Fill in table with their estimates
   - Total value of services

4. **Comparison (1 minute):**
   - "Compare: Taxes paid vs. Services value"
   - "Are you net recipient or net contributor?"

**Key Insight:**
"Most young people are NET RECIPIENTS:"
- You've used schools ($156k value) but haven't paid lifetime of taxes yet
- This is intergenerational transfer
- As you age and earn more, you become net contributor

**Coaching Questions:**
- "How much would private school cost?" (~$12k/year)
- "What would you do without police?" (Pay private security)
- "Could you afford these services privately?" (Probably not all)

---

#### Part C: Regulation Impact (5 minutes)

**Facilitation:**

1. **Introduction (1 minute):**
   - "Regulations have hidden costs AND benefits"
   - "Let's identify both"

2. **Complete Table (3 minutes):**

Students analyze {{STATE_NAME}} regulations:
- Occupational licensing
- Emissions testing
- Building codes
- Minimum wage
- Zoning laws

For each: Purpose, Your Cost, Your Benefit

**Example - Minimum Wage:**
- Purpose: Higher worker pay
- Your Cost: Higher prices at businesses
- Your Benefit: If you earn minimum wage, higher income

3. **Analysis (1 minute):**
   - "Which regulations provide good value (benefits > costs)?"
   - "Which are excessive (costs > benefits)?"

**Common Student Insights:**
- Building codes: High benefits (safety), moderate costs
- Occupational licensing: Mixed (some necessary, some excessive)
- Minimum wage: Hotly debated (depends on level)

**Avoid:** Political debate. Refocus on economics: "What does EVIDENCE show?"

---

### Activity 2: Policy Cost-Benefit Analysis (15 minutes)

**Objective:** Systematically evaluate proposed policies

---

**Facilitation:**

1. **Introduction (2 minutes):**
   - "Choose ONE policy to analyze using systematic framework"
   - "This is how economists and policymakers evaluate proposals"

2. **Policy Options:**
   ☐ Raise {{STATE_NAME}} minimum wage to $15/hour
   ☐ Make public community college free in {{STATE_NAME}}
   ☐ Implement statewide carbon tax
   ☐ Ban single-use plastic bags in {{STATE_NAME}}
   ☐ Increase gas tax by $0.10/gallon for infrastructure
   ☐ Require paid family leave for all employers

3. **Independent Work (11 minutes):**

Students work through 6-step framework:
- **Step 1:** Identify the problem (market failure?)
- **Step 2:** Benefits (who benefits, how much?)
- **Step 3:** Costs (who's harmed, how much?)
- **Step 4:** Unintended consequences
- **Step 5:** Alternatives
- **Step 6:** Recommendation (implement/modify/reject)

**Circulate and Monitor:**

**Good questions to ask:**
- "What's the market failure being addressed?"
- "Who are the stakeholders?"
- "How confident are you in these estimates?"
- "What evidence would change your mind?"

**Common Errors:**
- Only considering benefits, ignoring costs
- Only considering costs, ignoring benefits
- Not identifying unintended consequences
- Making recommendation based on ideology, not analysis

**Coaching:**
- "Think about ALL groups affected, not just obvious ones"
- "Estimates don't need to be exact - ballpark is fine"
- "Always ask: What could go wrong that we're not anticipating?"

4. **Quick Share (2 minutes):**

**Optional if time allows:**
- "Who analyzed minimum wage increase? What's your verdict?"
- "Who analyzed free community college? Recommendation?"
- "Notice how smart people can disagree based on same facts"

**Key Teaching Point:**
"There's rarely ONE RIGHT ANSWER. It depends on:"
- How you weight benefits vs. costs
- Your values (freedom vs. security, growth vs. equality)
- Your confidence in government implementation
- Evidence about effectiveness

---

### Example Walk-Through (If Students Need Guidance)

**Minimum Wage Increase to $15/hour:**

**Problem:** Low-wage workers struggle to afford living expenses

**Benefits:**
- 1-2M workers in typical state: +$5,000-$10,000/year income
- Reduced poverty
- More consumer spending

**Costs:**
- Small businesses: Higher labor costs → may cut hours, raise prices, or close
- Consumers: 1-4% price increase in affected sectors
- Some workers: May lose jobs (estimates: 0-3% employment loss)

**Unintended Consequences:**
- Faster automation (kiosks replace cashiers)
- Businesses move to lower-wage states
- Reduced entry-level opportunities for teens

**Alternatives:**
- Expand Earned Income Tax Credit
- Local minimum wages (vary by cost of living)
- Gradual increase with inflation indexing

**Verdict:** Debated! Economists disagree.

---

### Activity 3: Regulation Deep Dive (10 minutes)

**Objective:** Analyze specific {{STATE_NAME}} regulation in detail

---

**Facilitation:**

1. **Introduction (2 minutes):**
   - "Choose one {{STATE_NAME}} regulation to analyze deeply"
   - "Use the analysis template"

2. **Regulation Options:**
   ☐ {{STATE_NAME}} occupational licensing (cosmetology, contractors, etc.)
   ☐ {{STATE_NAME}} environmental regulations
   ☐ {{STATE_NAME}} rent control (if applicable)
   ☐ {{STATE_NAME}} certificate of need laws (healthcare)
   ☐ {{STATE_NAME}} zoning and land use regulations

3. **Independent Work (7 minutes):**

Students answer:
1. What does the regulation require?
2. What problem was it intended to solve?
3. Does it solve that problem?
4. What are the costs? (To consumers, businesses, society)
5. Who benefits?
6. Who's harmed?
7. Your verdict: Keep/Reform/Repeal

**Circulate and Monitor:**

**For occupational licensing:**
- "How many training hours required?"
- "Is that reasonable for the skills needed?"
- "Compare to other professions - is it consistent?"
- "Who benefits most? (Often existing license holders)"

**For environmental regulations:**
- "What's the environmental benefit?"
- "What's the compliance cost?"
- "Are there cheaper ways to achieve same goal?"

**For zoning:**
- "How does it affect housing supply?"
- "Who benefits? (Often existing homeowners)"
- "Who's harmed? (Often young people priced out)"

4. **Brief Debrief (1 minute):**
   - "Who found regulation that should be reformed?"
   - "What would you change?"

**Example: Cosmetology Licensing**

Many states require 1,500 hours (9-12 months) of training for hair stylists:
- **Intended:** Safety and sanitation
- **Actual:** 1,500 hours is more than EMT training (150 hrs)
- **Cost:** High barrier to entry, especially for low-income
- **Benefit:** Basic safety standards
- **Verdict:** Reform - Reduce to reasonable safety standard (300 hrs?)

**Key Teaching Point:**
"Regulations often start with good intentions but become excessive over time. Smart policy requires periodic review: Are benefits still exceeding costs?"

---

### Closing Activity: Your Political Economy Philosophy (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Students reflect on their overall views

---

**Facilitation:**

1. **Display Spectrum (1 minute):**

```
More Market ←——————————————→ More Government
(Less intervention)      (More intervention)

Libertarian → Conservative → Moderate → Progressive → Socialist
```

2. **Individual Reflection (3 minutes):**

Students answer:
1. When should government intervene in markets?
2. Which is bigger problem: too much or too little government?
3. What's your priority: freedom & growth OR security & equity?
4. {{STATE_NAME}}-specific: Should state have more/less taxes, regulations, services?

**Key Teaching Points:**

"Your philosophy may change as you learn more. These are COMPLEX issues without easy answers."

"Smart citizens:"
- Consider EVIDENCE, not just ideology
- Recognize TRADE-OFFS
- Admit UNCERTAINTY
- Update views when facts change

3. **Closing Insight (1 minute):**

"Biggest insight from today?"

**Expected responses:**
- "I didn't realize how much I pay in taxes"
- "Government provides more than I thought"
- "Policy analysis is harder than I thought"
- "Smart people can disagree based on different values"

**Final Message:**

"You now have frameworks to analyze ANY government policy:"
- Identify market failure
- Map winners and losers
- Assess costs and benefits
- Consider unintended consequences
- Evaluate alternatives

"Use these frameworks when you vote, when you advocate for policy, when you make consumer choices."

"That's what informed citizenship looks like."

## Differentiation Strategies

**For Struggling Students:**
- Provide partially completed tables with examples
- Focus on 1-2 activities rather than all four
- Pair with stronger student for cost-benefit analysis
- Use more concrete, local examples

**For Advanced Students:**
- Calculate lifetime value of tax payments and services received
- Research specific {{STATE_NAME}} policies in depth (find academic studies)
- Create detailed policy proposal with implementation plan
- Analyze how policies change over time (historical analysis)

**For ELL Students:**
- Pre-teach policy vocabulary (subsidy, regulation, taxation, redistribution)
- Provide sentence frames for analysis questions
- Allow use of translation tools
- Pair with bilingual peer for discussion

**For IEP Students:**
- Provide graphic organizers for policy analysis
- Break activities into smaller chunks with more frequent check-ins
- Allow oral responses instead of written
- Provide calculator and tax tables

---

## Assessment

**Formative (During Class):**
- Quality of tax burden calculations
- Depth of cost-benefit analysis
- Reasoning in regulation evaluation
- Ability to consider multiple perspectives

**Summative:**

**Option 1: Policy Analysis Portfolio**
Students submit:
- Completed Activity 2 (cost-benefit analysis)
- Completed Activity 3 (regulation deep dive)
- Closing reflection with political economy philosophy

**Grading Rubric:**
- Identifies market failure correctly (20%)
- Comprehensively lists benefits and costs (25%)
- Considers unintended consequences (15%)
- Evaluates alternatives (15%)
- Makes evidence-based recommendation (15%)
- Shows critical thinking and nuance (10%)

**Option 2: {{STATE_NAME}} Policy Brief**
Students write 1-2 page brief analyzing a {{STATE_NAME}} policy:
- Problem statement
- Policy description
- Stakeholder analysis
- Cost-benefit assessment
- Recommendation

---

## Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1: Students' tax burden seems abstract**
- **Solution:** Use their actual expected income. "When you earn $40k, here's exactly what you'll pay."

**Challenge 2: Wide disagreement on policy analysis**
- **Solution:** Emphasize this is GOOD. "Smart people disagree because values differ and evidence is mixed."

**Challenge 3: Students want definitive answers**
- **Solution:** "Economics provides frameworks, not always clear answers. Your job is to think through trade-offs."

**Challenge 4: Cost-benefit analysis takes longer than expected**
- **Solution:** Have students focus on Steps 1-3, 6 (problem, benefits, costs, recommendation). Skip Steps 4-5 if time short.

**Challenge 5: Limited {{STATE_NAME}} data availability**
- **Solution:** Prepare data sheets beforehand, have students estimate when exact data unavailable

**Challenge 6: Discussion becomes too political**
- **Solution:** Refocus on ECONOMICS. "Let's analyze costs and benefits, not debate political ideology."

## Materials Needed

- Student learning lab content (day2.md)
- Calculators
- {{STATE_NAME}} tax rates and regulation data
- Whiteboard for collecting insights
- Timer
- Political economy spectrum visual
- Optional: Current policy debates from news

---

## Connection to Day 1

Reference yesterday's concepts throughout:

- **Market failures:** "Remember the five types from yesterday? Which one does this policy address?"
- **Externalities:** "Is this a negative externality that justifies a tax?"
- **Public goods:** "Why does government provide this instead of private companies?"
- **Information asymmetry:** "Does this regulation solve information problem?"

---

## Connection to L-53 (Preview)

**Closing Preview (30 seconds):**

"Tomorrow: L-53 - Fiscal and Monetary Policy"

"Now that you understand government's role in markets, we'll explore:"
- How government uses spending and taxes to stabilize economy
- How Federal Reserve controls money supply and interest rates
- How these policies affect YOUR finances (job prospects, interest rates, purchasing power)

"Question to think about: What should government do during a recession?"

---

## Key Takeaways to Emphasize

At end of class, ensure students understand:

✓ **Tax burden analysis** - You can calculate what you pay and what you get

✓ **Cost-benefit framework** - Systematic method to evaluate any policy

✓ **Multiple perspectives** - Winners and losers in every policy

✓ **{{STATE_NAME}} policies affect YOU** - Directly impact your finances and choices

✓ **Informed citizenship** - You now have tools to evaluate policies critically

✓ **No easy answers** - Smart people disagree based on different values and priorities

---

## Notes for Next Year

- Update {{STATE_NAME}} tax data annually (rates change)
- Refresh policy options with current debates
- Collect student policy analyses as examples for future years
- Consider adding more collaborative elements (pair work on cost-benefit analysis)
- Activity 1 needs full 20 minutes - don't rush
- Political economy spectrum works well - keep it
- Some students want MORE time on cost-benefit analysis - consider extending

---

## Success Indicators

Students successfully completed today if they can:
- Calculate their approximate tax burden
- Identify market failures in real policies
- Systematically analyze costs and benefits
- Consider multiple stakeholder perspectives
- Make evidence-based policy recommendations
- Articulate their own political economy philosophy with reasoning

**Most Important:** Students leave with FRAMEWORKS for analysis, not just opinions.
