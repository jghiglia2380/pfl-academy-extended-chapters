# L-66: Understanding Financial Markets - Teacher Guide (Day 2 - Learning Lab)

## Learning Lab Overview
Today's session is almost entirely hands-on practice—students read real stock quotes, execute simulated trades with different order types, calculate trading costs, explore actual brokerage platforms, and develop personalized trading strategies. This active learning approach (90% activities, 10% instruction/reflection) ensures students leave with practical skills they'll use when they begin investing, not just theoretical knowledge.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will be able to:
- Read and interpret stock quotes to make informed trading decisions
- Execute trades using appropriate order types for different situations
- Calculate the true cost of trading including hidden spread costs
- Navigate brokerage platforms and compare broker features
- Develop a personal trading strategy that minimizes costs

## Detailed Facilitation Guide

### Setup & Overview (5 minutes)

**Opening:**
"Yesterday you learned how markets work. Today you practice the skills you'll use when investing real money."

**Quick Review:**
- "What's the difference between bid and ask?" (Bid = what buyers pay, ask = what sellers receive)
- "When do you use a limit order?" (Want to control price, willing to risk non-execution)
- "What's the hidden cost in 'commission-free' trading?" (Bid-ask spread)

**Activity Preview:**
Walk through the 5 stations briefly. **Emphasize:** "All activities are practical—everything you do today applies directly to your investing future."

### Activity 1: Quote Reading Challenge (10 minutes)

**Role:** Monitor and coach

**Launch:**
- "Access Yahoo Finance or Google Finance"
- "Look up 3 stocks: one large-cap, one small-cap, one ETF"
- "Record all metrics in your worksheet"

**Circulate and Assist:**
- Help students find quote pages
- Point out where to find bid, ask, volume
- Guide spread calculations

**Coaching Prompts:**
- "Which has the narrowest spread percentage? What does that tell you?"
- "If you were buying $1,000 of this stock with a market order, how much would spreads cost you?"
- "Which stock would you feel comfortable using a market order for?"

**Common Issues:**
- **Can't find bid/ask**: Usually under "Detailed Quote" or similar link
- **Confused by spread percentage**: Demonstrate: (spread ÷ ask) × 100
- **Not seeing liquidity connection**: Point out volume—high volume = narrow spread typically

**Debrief (2 min):**
"Show of hands: Who found a stock with spread less than 0.1%?" (Highly liquid)
"Who found spread greater than 1%?" (Consider limit orders for these)

### Activity 2: Trading Simulator Practice (15 minutes)

**Role:** Coach and troubleshooter

**Launch:**
- "Open Market Trading Simulator"
- "Work through all 5 scenarios"
- "Compare market vs. limit order outcomes"

**Scenario Monitoring:**

**Scenario 1 (Market Orders):**
- Watch for students seeing they pay ask, receive bid
- Prompt: "Calculate your loss if you bought then immediately sold"

**Scenario 2-3 (Limit Orders):**
- Students should experience both execution and non-execution
- Prompt: "Which is worse: paying $0.05 extra or missing the trade entirely?"

**Scenario 4 (Selling):**
- Ensure students see they CAN set sell limit above current ask
- Prompt: "You're trying to get a better price—is it worth the wait?"

**Scenario 5 (Volatility):**
- Highlight how wide spreads make limit orders critical
- Prompt: "In volatile markets, what's the risk of market orders?"

**Red Flags:**
- Student using market orders for everything: "Try scenarios 2-5 with limit orders—compare costs"
- Student placing illogical limits (buy limit above ask): "You'd pay more than necessary—limits should save money"
- Frustration with non-execution: "That's the trade-off—better prices require patience"

**Debrief (2 min):**
"What did you learn about market vs. limit orders?"
"When would you definitely use a limit order?" (Wide spreads, volatile markets, no rush)

### Activity 3: Cost Analysis (12 minutes)

**Role:** Guide calculations and provide context

**Part 1: Single Trade (4 min)**

**Circulate and assist:**
- Help with spread calculations
- Verify commission understanding
- Ensure students see hidden costs

**Key Points:**
- "Even $0 commission doesn't mean free"
- "Spreads are percentage of trade, not fixed fee"
- "Illiquid stocks can have massive spread costs"

**Part 2: Annual Costs (4 min)**

**Help students with profiles:**
- Active trader: 100 trades/year
- Moderate: 12 trades/year
- Buy-and-hold: 4 trades/year

**Ensure accurate calculations:**
- Spread cost per trade = spread × shares
- Annual cost = trades × cost per trade

**Part 3: Lifetime Impact (4 min)**

**This is the "wow" moment:**
- Use the formula or provide calculator
- Show active trader loses $75,000+ vs. buy-and-hold
- Emphasize: "Same market returns, different costs"

**Discussion:**
"Raise your hand if you're reconsidering frequent trading" (Most should)
"What strategy makes sense for long-term wealth building?" (Low-cost, infrequent)

### Activity 4: Brokerage Exploration (13 minutes)

**Role:** Navigator and comparison facilitator

**Part 1: Platform Tour (7 min)**

**Guide exploration:**
- "Visit 2-3 broker sites"
- "Don't open accounts—just explore demos"
- "Look for: ease of use, costs, features"

**What to point out:**
- Where to find commission info (usually buried in FAQs)
- Research tools quality
- Platform complexity (simple vs. overwhelming)
- Hidden fees (account minimums, inactivity fees)

**Brokers to suggest:**
- Fidelity (good for beginners, strong research)
- Charles Schwab (excellent education, solid platform)
- TD Ameritrade (thinkorswim is advanced but powerful)

**Part 2: Comparison (6 min)**

**Help students build comparison chart:**
- Compare apples-to-apples (all must answer same questions)
- Focus on: commissions, minimums, ease of use, support

**Prompt critical thinking:**
- "Cheapest isn't always best—what else matters?"
- "Which platform would YOU actually use?"
- "What red flags did you notice?" (Hidden fees, pushy margin offers)

**Class Synthesis:**
"Which broker got the most votes? Why?"
"What surprised you about brokerages?"

### Activity 5: Personal Strategy Development (10 minutes)

**Role:** Strategy consultant

**Part 1: Investor Profile (3 min)**

**Help students be honest:**
- "How much time WILL you actually spend on this?"
- "Are you genuinely comfortable with risk or just saying it?"
- "What's realistic for your personality?"

**Part 2: Trading Rules (4 min)**

**Guide rule creation:**
- Rules should be specific and actionable
- "I'll check spread before every trade" is better than "I'll try to save money"
- Link rules to their profile

**Example feedback:**
- "You said you're busy—monthly index fund contributions make sense"
- "You want to pick stocks—fine, but limit to 10% of portfolio"
- "You're risk-averse—focus on broad ETFs, not individual stocks"

**Part 3: First Trade Plan (3 min)**

**Ensure realistic planning:**
- Appropriate dollar amount (not life savings for first trade)
- Reasonable security (not speculative penny stock)
- Clear rationale (not "I heard about it on social media")

**Feedback prompts:**
- "Why this specific investment?"
- "How does it fit your goals?"
- "What's your plan if it drops 20%?"

**Celebrate good planning:**
"This is exactly the kind of thoughtful approach successful investors take"

### Reflection & Wrap-Up (5 minutes)

**Individual Reflection (3 min):**
Give quiet time for completion

**Action Commitments (2 min):**
"Who will open a brokerage account in the next 3 months?" (Show of hands)
"Who will start with index funds?" (Majority should)
"Who learned something that will save them money?" (Everyone should)

**Closing:**
"You now know more about market mechanics than most adults who've been investing for years. Use this knowledge to invest wisely, minimize costs, and build wealth over time."

## Assessment & Monitoring

**What to observe:**
- Can students correctly identify bid, ask, and spread?
- Do they understand order type trade-offs?
- Are calculations accurate?
- Do trading strategies align with stated goals?

**Red flags:**
- Student planning unrealistic active trading
- Student choosing speculative first investments
- Student not understanding spread costs
- Student overwhelmed by complexity

## Differentiation

### Advanced
- Explore stop-loss and other advanced order types
- Research market maker profitability
- Analyze high-frequency trading impacts

### Support
- Pre-fill some worksheet sections
- Pair with stronger student
- Focus on one broker instead of comparing multiple
- Simplify strategy to: "Buy index fund quarterly"

### ELL
- Provide translated vocabulary
- Allow extra time for reading broker sites
- Offer verbal explanations alongside written

## Troubleshooting

**Technology fails:** Have printable scenarios with manual calculations

**Broker sites blocked:** Use screenshots/recorded demos instead

**Students finish early:** Extension: "Research your chosen stock's fundamentals—is it truly a good investment?"

**Low engagement:** Make it competitive—"Who can find the highest spread stock?" "Lowest cost broker?"
