## Pedagogical Approach

### Day 1 Philosophy
- Demystify markets (not mysterious, just organized systems)
- Use real examples students can verify (look up actual stocks)
- Connect every concept to personal financial impact
- Build from concrete (spreads) to abstract (market structure)

### Day 2 Philosophy
- 90% hands-on (minimal lecture, maximum practice)
- Progress from guided (simulator) to independent (strategy development)
- Culminate in personal application (own trading plan)
- Emphasize practical skills over theoretical knowledge

### Teacher Role
- Day 1: Instructor with demonstrations (show real quotes, platforms)
- Day 2: Coach and monitor (circulate, assist, provide feedback)
- Throughout: Connect to wealth-building, not day trading
