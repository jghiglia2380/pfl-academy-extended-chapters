## Facilitation Guide

### Activity 1: Real vs. Nominal Calculations (15 min)

**Part A: Shrinking Dollar (7 min)**
- Students calculate $10,000 purchasing power over time
- Formula: Real Value = Nominal / (1 + inflation)^years
- At 2%: After 30 years = $5,521 (lost 45%)
- At 5%: After 30 years = $2,314 (lost 77%)
- At 8%: After 30 years = $994 (lost 90%)

**Key Insight:** Cash loses value - must invest to beat inflation

**Part B: Salary Adjustment (8 min)**
- Compare two job offers with different raise structures
- Offer 1: $60k with 2% raises
- Offer 2: $55k with 4% raises
- At 3% inflation, Offer 2 wins after 10 years
- **Teaching Point:** Real salary growth matters, not nominal raises

**Common Challenge:** Math intimidates some students
- **Solution:** Walk through formula step-by-step, allow calculator use, focus on concept not precision

### Activity 2: Inflation Protection Strategies (20 min)

**Part A: Investment Strategies (8 min)**
- $10,000 allocation across options
- Cash (0.5%): Loses value
- High-yield savings (4.5%): Barely beats inflation
- Stocks (10%): Best long-term, volatile
- Bonds (5%): Moderate risk/return
- TIPS: Guaranteed to beat inflation

**Key Teaching Point:**
- Young people can take more risk (stocks)
- Diversification balances risk and return
- Must invest to beat inflation

**Part B: Wage Negotiation (6 min)**
- Frame raise request around inflation + real increase
- Example: 3.5% inflation + 2% real = 5.5% ask
- Provide evidence: CPI data, achievements, market rates
- **Coaching:** Role-play negotiation if time

**Part C: Spending Adjustments (6 min)**
- Buy bulk, generic brands, delay luxuries
- Accelerate necessary purchases
- Subscription audit ($273/month average!)
- Energy efficiency

**Monitor:** Are students identifying realistic cuts?

### Activity 3: Unemployment Navigation (10 min)

**Part A: Job Market Strategies (7 min)**
- Frictional: Network, be selective, negotiate strongly
- Structural: Retrain, target growth industries, transferable skills
- Cyclical: Lower expectations, unemployment benefits, gig work, upskill

**Part B: Personal Protection Plan (8 min)**
- Emergency fund: 6 months expenses
- Skills portfolio: Continuous learning
- Network building: 20 connections/year
- Financial flexibility: Fixed costs ≤50% income

**Key Teaching Point:** Preparation beats luck - build safety nets before crisis

---

### Closing: Personal Resilience Plan (5 min)
- Students identify #1 action for inflation protection
- Students identify #1 action for unemployment protection
- Encourage immediate implementation

---

## Assessment

**Formative:**
- Quality of calculations (real vs. nominal)
- Thoughtfulness of investment allocation
- Realism of protection strategies

**Summative Options:**
1. **Portfolio:** Completed all activities with analysis
2. **Personal Plan:** Written 2-page financial resilience strategy
3. **Scenario Analysis:** Given economic conditions, recommend actions

---

## Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1:** "I can't invest, I don't have money"
- **Solution:** Emphasize starting small ($10-50/month), importance of habit

**Challenge 2:** "Wage negotiation seems scary"
- **Solution:** Role-play, provide scripts, emphasize data-driven approach

**Challenge 3:** Math anxiety
- **Solution:** Focus on concepts, allow calculator use, partner work

**Challenge 4:** "This is too far in future"
- **Solution:** Use near-term examples (first job negotiation in 2 years, need emergency fund now)
