# L-54: Inflation, Unemployment, and Personal Finance
## Teacher Guide - Day 1: Understanding Inflation and Unemployment

### Lesson Overview
Students learn what inflation is, how it's measured (CPI), causes (demand-pull, cost-push, monetary), types of unemployment (frictional, structural, cyclical), and the Phillips Curve trade-off.

**Total Time:** 55 minutes
**Format:** Direct instruction with examples and discussion
**Key Outcome:** Students understand inflation and unemployment as key economic indicators affecting their finances

## Setup & Preparation

**Before Class:**
- [ ] Display 1970 vs. 2024 price comparison on board
- [ ] Prepare CPI explanation with current data
- [ ] Have inflation rate historical chart ready
- [ ] Prepare unemployment rate current data (US and {{STATE_NAME}})
- [ ] Draw Phillips Curve diagram
- [ ] Review 1970s stagflation example
- [ ] Have calculators ready for real vs. nominal calculations

**Materials Needed:**
- Student content (day1.md)
- Current CPI and inflation data (BLS website)
- Current unemployment data (BLS, {{STATE_NAME}} labor department)
- Historical charts (inflation, unemployment)
- Phillips Curve diagram
- Calculators
- Whiteboard
- Timer

## Key Teaching Points

### Opening: Dollar Then vs. Now (5 min)
- Hook: Parents' dollar bought WAY more than yours
- Display prices: Home $23k → $420k, College $400 → $10k
- This is inflation - sustained price increases
- Affects everyone's purchasing power

### Inflation Measurement - CPI (10 min)
- CPI = basket of goods average price
- Housing 43%, food 15%, transportation 17%
- Inflation rate = % change in CPI
- Fed targets 2% (stable, predictable)
- Current ~3% (above target, but falling from 8.5% peak)

### Causes of Inflation (10 min)
**Demand-Pull:** Too much demand, too little supply
- Example: 2021 COVID stimulus + spending surge
**Cost-Push:** Production costs rise → prices rise
- Example: Oil shocks, supply chain disruptions
**Monetary:** Too much money printed
- Example: Hyperinflation (Zimbabwe, Venezuela)

### Types of Unemployment (15 min)
**Frictional:** Between jobs, temporary, normal (2-4 months)
**Structural:** Skills mismatch, requires retraining (months-years)
- Example: Coal miner when coal industry declines
**Cyclical:** Recession-related, economy-wide
- Example: 2008 (10%), 2020 COVID (14.7%)

**Natural Rate:** 4-5% (frictional + structural, not cyclical)
- "Full employment" ≠ zero unemployment

### Phillips Curve (10 min)
- Trade-off: Low unemployment ↔ High inflation
- Can't achieve both low simultaneously
- Fed must balance
- **Stagflation:** High both (1970s, worst case)
- Paul Volcker raised rates to 20% to break inflation

### Discussion Questions (5 min)
- Which worse: 7% inflation or 7% unemployment?
- Should government slow AI/automation to protect jobs?
- Did Fed make right call in 2022 raising rates?

## Differentiation & Assessment

**For Struggling Students:**
- Focus on CPI concept and one cause of inflation
- Simplify unemployment to two types (frictional, cyclical)
- Provide graphic organizers

**For Advanced Students:**
- Calculate CPI basket weights
- Research historical inflation episodes
- Analyze current Fed policy stance

**Formative Assessment:**
- Exit ticket: Given scenario, identify inflation cause and unemployment type

**Tomorrow:** Students calculate purchasing power erosion, develop protection strategies

## Notes for Next Year
- Update all price comparisons annually
- Current inflation/unemployment data changes
- Use most recent dramatic example (2021-22 inflation very effective)
- Phillips Curve diagram essential - draw clearly
- Students engaged by real vs. nominal calculations - emphasize tomorrow
