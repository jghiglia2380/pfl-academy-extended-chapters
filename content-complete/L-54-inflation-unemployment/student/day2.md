---

## Opening Reflection (5 minutes)

**Write:** Think about a purchase you made or plan to make in the next 5-10 years (car, home, education, etc.)

**Questions:**
- How much will it cost today?
- How much will it cost in 10 years with 3% annual inflation?
- Will your income keep pace with inflation?
- What can you do to protect yourself?

Keep these in mind as we develop inflation-protection strategies.

## Learning Lab Activities

### Activity 1: Real vs. Nominal Value Calculations (15 minutes)

**Objective:** Calculate purchasing power erosion and understand real vs. nominal values

---

#### Part A: The Shrinking Dollar (7 minutes)

**Scenario: You save $10,000 under your mattress (earning 0% interest)**

**Calculate future purchasing power at different inflation rates:**

| Years | 2% Inflation | 5% Inflation | 8% Inflation |
|-------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| 0 (today) | $10,000 | $10,000 | $10,000 |
| 5 years | $_______ | $_______ | $_______ |
| 10 years | $_______ | $_______ | $_______ |
| 20 years | $_______ | $_______ | $_______ |
| 30 years | $_______ | $_______ | $_______ |

**Formula:**
```
Real Value = Nominal Value / (1 + Inflation Rate)^Years

Example (2% inflation, 10 years):
Real Value = $10,000 / (1.02)^10 = $10,000 / 1.219 = $8,203
```

**Your Calculations:**

**2% Inflation:**
- 5 years: $10,000 / (1.02)^5 = $10,000 / 1.104 = $________
- 10 years: $10,000 / (1.02)^10 = $10,000 / 1.219 = $8,203
- 20 years: $10,000 / (1.02)^20 = $________
- 30 years: $10,000 / (1.02)^30 = $________

**5% Inflation:**
- 5 years: $10,000 / (1.05)^5 = $________
- 10 years: $10,000 / (1.05)^10 = $________
- 20 years: $10,000 / (1.05)^20 = $________
- 30 years: $10,000 / (1.05)^30 = $________

**8% Inflation (high):**
- 5 years: $10,000 / (1.08)^5 = $________
- 10 years: $10,000 / (1.08)^10 = $________
- 20 years: $10,000 / (1.08)^20 = $________
- 30 years: $10,000 / (1.08)^30 = $________

**Key Insights:**

**At 2% inflation (Fed's target):**
- After 30 years, $10,000 worth only $5,521
- Lost 45% of purchasing power
- **Holding cash is LOSING money**

**At 5% inflation:**
- After 30 years, $10,000 worth only $2,314
- Lost 77% of purchasing power!

**At 8% inflation:**
- After 30 years, $10,000 worth only $994
- Lost 90% of purchasing power!

**Analysis Questions:**

1. **What's the opportunity cost of holding cash?**
   - _______________________________________________________

2. **How much interest must you earn to maintain purchasing power?**
   - At minimum: Interest rate must equal inflation rate
   - 3% inflation → Need 3% return to break even
   - 5% inflation → Need 5% return to break even

3. **What if your salary only grows 1% per year but inflation is 3%?**
   - Real salary DECLINES 2% per year
   - After 10 years: Real salary = 98% × 10 = 82% of original
   - You're earning 18% LESS in purchasing power!

---

#### Part B: Salary Adjustment for Inflation (8 minutes)

**Scenario: You're offered a job with salary that grows over time**

**Offer 1:** $60,000 starting salary, guaranteed 2% annual raise

**Offer 2:** $55,000 starting salary, guaranteed 4% annual raise

**Question:** Which is better if inflation is 3%/year?

**Calculate Real Salary After 10 Years:**

**Offer 1:**
- Nominal salary year 10: $60,000 × (1.02)^10 = $60,000 × 1.219 = $73,140
- Inflation adjustment: / (1.03)^10 = / 1.344
- **Real salary year 10:** $73,140 / 1.344 = $54,420

**Offer 2:**
- Nominal salary year 10: $55,000 × (1.04)^10 = $55,000 × 1.480 = $81,400
- Inflation adjustment: / (1.03)^10 = / 1.344
- **Real salary year 10:** $81,400 / 1.344 = $60,565

**Which is Better?**
- Offer 2! Despite lower starting salary, 4% raises beat inflation
- After 10 years, Offer 2 provides $6,145 MORE in real purchasing power

**Your Calculation:**

**Your current or expected starting salary:** $__________

**Expected annual raise:** _____%

**Expected inflation:** 3%

**Calculate real salary in 10 years:**
1. Nominal salary: Starting × (1 + raise%)^10 = $________
2. Inflation factor: (1.03)^10 = 1.344
3. Real salary: Nominal / 1.344 = $________

**Analysis:**
- Is your real salary growing or shrinking?
- If raise% < inflation%, you're losing purchasing power
- If raise% = inflation%, you're treading water
- If raise% > inflation%, you're gaining purchasing power

**Key Insight:** Focus on REAL salary growth, not nominal raises. 5% raise sounds great, but if inflation is 7%, you're losing 2% in purchasing power.

### Activity 2: Inflation Protection Strategies (20 minutes)

**Objective:** Develop comprehensive strategy to protect against inflation

---

#### Part A: Investment Strategies (8 minutes)

**You have $10,000 to invest. Inflation is 3%/year. What should you do?**

**Option 1: Cash/Savings Account**
- Interest rate: 0.5%/year
- After 10 years: $10,000 × (1.005)^10 = $10,511 (nominal)
- Inflation-adjusted: $10,511 / (1.03)^10 = $10,511 / 1.344 = $7,821
- **Result:** LOST $2,179 in purchasing power (-22%)

**Option 2: High-Yield Savings**
- Interest rate: 4.5%/year
- After 10 years: $10,000 × (1.045)^10 = $15,530 (nominal)
- Inflation-adjusted: $15,530 / 1.344 = $11,556
- **Result:** GAINED $1,556 (+16%)

**Option 3: Stock Market (Historical Average)**
- Average return: 10%/year (historical)
- After 10 years: $10,000 × (1.10)^10 = $25,937 (nominal)
- Inflation-adjusted: $25,937 / 1.344 = $19,303
- **Result:** GAINED $9,303 (+93%)
- **Risk:** Volatile, can lose value short-term

**Option 4: Bonds**
- Average return: 5%/year
- After 10 years: $10,000 × (1.05)^10 = $16,289 (nominal)
- Inflation-adjusted: $16,289 / 1.344 = $12,122
- **Result:** GAINED $2,122 (+21%)
- **Risk:** Lower risk than stocks

**Option 5: Real Estate**
- Average appreciation: 4%/year (historical)
- After 10 years: $10,000 × (1.04)^10 = $14,802 (nominal)
- Inflation-adjusted: $14,802 / 1.344 = $11,016
- **Result:** GAINED $1,016 (+10%)
- **Plus:** Rental income if investment property

**Option 6: Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)**
- Return: Inflation rate + 0.5%
- Automatically adjusts for inflation
- After 10 years: $10,000 × (1.035)^10 = $14,106 (nominal)
- Already inflation-adjusted! Real value: $14,106 / 1.344 = $10,496
- **Result:** GAINED $496 (+5%)
- **Benefit:** Guaranteed to beat inflation (safe)

**Your Investment Strategy:**

Allocate $10,000 across options:

| Investment | Amount | Expected Real Return (10 years) |
|------------|--------|--------------------------------|
| High-yield savings | $______ | ×  1.156 = $______ |
| Stocks | $______ | × 1.930 = $______ |
| Bonds | $______ | × 1.212 = $______ |
| Real estate | $______ | × 1.102 = $______ |
| TIPS | $______ | × 1.050 = $______ |
| **TOTAL** | **$10,000** | **$______** |

**Diversification:**
- Don't put all eggs in one basket
- Balance risk and return
- Younger = can take more risk (stocks)
- Older = need more stability (bonds, TIPS)

**Example Allocation (Age 25):**
- Stocks: 60% ($6,000) → $11,580 real value
- Bonds: 20% ($2,000) → $2,424
- TIPS: 10% ($1,000) → $1,050
- High-yield savings: 10% ($1,000) → $1,156 (emergency fund)
- **Total after 10 years:** $16,210 (real value)
- **Gain:** $6,210 (+62%)

**Key Insight:** MUST invest to beat inflation. Cash loses value. Diversified portfolio grows wealth.

#### Part B: Wage Negotiation Strategy (6 minutes)

**Scenario: Annual performance review, time to negotiate raise**

**Standard raise:** 2% (matches inflation barely)

**You want:** Real raise (inflation + additional)

**Inflation Strategy Negotiation:**

**Step 1: Know the Numbers**
- Current salary: $60,000
- Current inflation rate: 3.5%
- Your target real raise: 2% (above inflation)
- **Total raise needed:** 3.5% + 2% = 5.5%

**Step 2: Frame the Request**

**Weak approach:**
"I'd like a 5.5% raise."

**Strong approach:**
"Given inflation is currently 3.5%, my purchasing power has declined. To maintain my standard of living AND recognize my contributions [list achievements], I'm requesting a 5.5% increase. This represents a 2% real raise above inflation."

**Step 3: Provide Evidence**
- **Inflation data:** CPI reports (official government data)
- **Your contributions:** Quantify achievements
  - "Increased sales by 15%"
  - "Saved department $20,000"
  - "Led successful project"
- **Market data:** "Similar roles in {{STATE_NAME}} pay $65,000"

**Step 4: Be Prepared to Walk**
- If company won't adjust for inflation, consider job searching
- Switching jobs often yields 10-20% raise (more than internal raises)
- Inflation makes staying put more expensive

**Your Negotiation Plan:**

**Current salary:** $__________

**Current inflation:** _____%

**Desired real raise:** _____%

**Total raise to request:** _____% (inflation + real raise)

**Your key achievements to mention:**
1. _______________________________________________________
2. _______________________________________________________
3. _______________________________________________________

**Your ask (write it out):**
_______________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________

**Backup plan if denied:**
☐ Accept and search for new job
☐ Ask for performance-based bonus
☐ Request re-evaluation in 6 months
☐ Other: _______________________

**Key Insight:** If you don't negotiate inflation adjustments, you're effectively taking a pay CUT every year. Speak up!

- Insurance
- Student loans
- **Strategy:** Lock in rates when low (refinance before rates rise)

**Variable Costs (You Control):**
- Food
- Entertainment
- Clothing
- Subscriptions
- **Strategy:** Cut here during high inflation

**Inflation-Busting Spending Strategies:**

**1. Buy in Bulk (Non-Perishables)**
- Prices rising → Buy now before higher
- Items that don't expire: Toilet paper, cleaning supplies, canned goods
- **Savings:** 10-20% by buying before next price increase

**2. Generic/Store Brands**
- Brand-name premium not worth it during high inflation

- New car can wait
- Latest phone can wait
- Vacation can be modest
- **Reason:** Prices may stabilize or fall later

**4. Accelerate Necessary Purchases**
- Need new appliance? Buy before next price increase
- Need car repairs? Do them now (parts prices rising)
- Planning home improvement? Lock in quotes now

**5. Subscription Audit**
- List ALL subscriptions: Streaming, gym, apps, etc.
- Cancel unused ones
- **Average household:** $273/month in subscriptions, only uses half

**6. Energy Efficiency**
- Utilities rising with inflation
- LED bulbs, better insulation, programmable thermostat
- **Savings:** 15-25% on energy bills

**Your Spending Adjustment Plan:**

**Current monthly spending:** $__________

**Inflation impact (3% annual = 0.25% monthly):** +$________

**Where can you cut?**

| Category | Current Spending | Reduction | New Spending |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|--------------|
| Subscriptions | $______ | $______ | $______ |
| Eating out | $______ | $______ | $______ |
| Entertainment | $______ | $______ | $______ |
| Clothing | $______ | $______ | $______ |
| Other: _______ | $______ | $______ | $______ |
| **TOTAL** | **$______** | **$______** | **$______** |

**Offset inflation?** ☐ Yes ☐ No ☐ Partially

### Activity 4: Economic Scenario Analysis (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Make informed financial decisions in different economic conditions

**You have $25,000 to allocate. Choose strategy based on economic scenario:**

---

**Scenario 1: High Inflation (7%), Low Unemployment (3.5%)**

**Conditions:**
- Prices rising rapidly
- Jobs plentiful
- Interest rates high (5%)

**Your allocation:**
- Pay off high-interest debt: $________ (Credit cards 18% → BIG savings)
- Invest in stocks/real estate: $________ (Beats inflation)
- High-yield savings: $________ (5% return helps)
- TIPS (inflation-protected): $________ (Guaranteed to beat inflation)

**Rationale:**
- Inflation eroding cash value → Minimize cash holdings
- High rates make debt expensive → Pay it off
- Need inflation-beating investments → Stocks, real estate
- Job security high → Can take some risk

---

**Scenario 2: Low Inflation (1%), High Unemployment (9%)**

**Conditions:**
- Prices stable
- Jobs scarce, layoffs common
- Interest rates low (1%)

**Your allocation:**
- Emergency fund (cash): $________ (Job security LOW, need cushion)
- Pay off debt: $________ (Still good idea, but less urgent)
- Conservative investments (bonds): $________ (Protect principal)
- Minimal stocks: $________ (Recession risk)

**Rationale:**
- Job loss risk → Build cash cushion
- Recession → Preserve capital, less risk
- Low inflation → Cash not losing value rapidly
- Low interest rates → Debt cheap, but security matters more

---

**Scenario 3: High Inflation (6%), High Unemployment (8%) [Stagflation]**

**Conditions:**
- Prices rising
- Jobs scarce
- Interest rates high (6%)

**Your allocation (HARD CHOICES):**
- Emergency fund: $________ (Unemployment risk HIGH)
- Pay off high-interest debt: $________ (Expensive in stagflation)
- Inflation-protected assets: $________ (TIPS, commodities, real estate)
- Minimal growth investments: $________ (Risky environment)

**Rationale:**
- Need cash for job loss BUT cash losing value to inflation
- Must balance security and inflation protection
- High-interest debt is killer → Pay it off
- Stagflation is worst environment → Defensive strategy

---

**Your Scenario:**

**Current economic conditions:**
- Inflation: _____%
- Unemployment: _____%
- Interest rates: _____%

**Your allocation of $25,000:**
| Use | Amount | Reasoning |
