## Opening: Your Parents' Dollar vs. Your Dollar

**1970:**
- Median home price: $23,000
- Gallon of gas: $0.36
- Movie ticket: $1.50
- College tuition (public, 4-year): $400/year
- Minimum wage: $1.60/hour
- Median household income: $9,000

**2024:**
- Median home price: $420,000 (18x higher)
- Gallon of gas: $3.50 (10x higher)
- Movie ticket: $12.00 (8x higher)
- College tuition (public, 4-year): $10,000/year (25x higher!)
- Minimum wage: $7.25-15/hour (5-9x higher)
- Median household income: $75,000 (8x higher)

**The Problem:**
- Prices rose FASTER than wages in some areas (housing, education)
- Your parents' salary of $30,000 felt like $200,000 feels today
- A dollar today buys LESS than a dollar in 1970

**This is INFLATION.**

**But also:**

**Unemployment Rate:**
- 2020 COVID: 14.7% (1 in 7 couldn't find work)
- 2009 Great Recession: 10% (1 in 10 unemployed)
- 2023: 3.5% (near record low)

**Today's Goal:** Understand inflation and unemployment - the two key indicators that affect YOUR finances and job prospects.

## Connecting to What You've Learned

**From L-48 (Economic Systems):**
- {{STATE_NAME}}'s mixed economy experiences business cycles
- Inflation and unemployment vary over time
- Living standards affected by these indicators

**From L-49 (Opportunity Cost):**
- Inflation = opportunity cost of holding cash
- Money losing value over time
- Must invest or spend to avoid erosion

**From L-50 (Supply & Demand):**
- Price changes result from supply/demand shifts
- Economy-wide price changes = inflation
- Persistent increases in all prices

**From L-51 (Market Structures):**
- Competition limits price increases
- Monopolies have more pricing power during inflation
- Market structure affects inflation impact

**From L-52 (Government's Economic Role):**
- Government addresses market failures
- Economic stabilization is key role
- Policies aim to control inflation and unemployment

**From L-53 (Fiscal & Monetary Policy):**
- Fed's dual mandate: Maximum employment + price stability
- Interest rates affect both inflation and unemployment
- Trade-off: Can't always achieve both simultaneously

**Today's Framework:**
Inflation and unemployment are the TWO key targets of economic policy - and the TWO biggest threats to your financial wellbeing.

## What is Inflation?

**Inflation** = Sustained increase in the general level of prices over time

**Key Concepts:**

**Not just one price increasing:**
- Gas price spike due to hurricane = NOT inflation (temporary, one good)
- ALL prices rising persistently = INFLATION

**Purchasing power declines:**
- Same dollar buys fewer goods/services
- Real value of money falls
- Wages must rise just to maintain same living standard

**Measured as annual percentage:**
- "Inflation is 3%" = Prices rose 3% over past year
- Your dollar now worth $0.97 compared to last year

---

### How Inflation is Measured: Consumer Price Index (CPI)

**Consumer Price Index (CPI)** = Average price of a "basket" of goods and services typical consumers buy

**The Basket Includes:**
- Food and beverages (15%)
- Housing (shelter, utilities) (43%)
- Transportation (gas, cars, insurance) (17%)
- Medical care (9%)
- Education and communication (6%)
- Recreation (5%)
- Apparel (3%)
- Other (2%)

**How CPI Works:**

1. **Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys** 80,000 items each month
2. **Compares prices** to base year (currently 1982-84 = 100)
3. **Calculates index:** Current CPI ~ 310 (prices are 3.1x higher than 1982-84)

**Inflation Rate Calculation:**

```
Inflation Rate = (CPI this year - CPI last year) / CPI last year × 100%

Example:
CPI 2023: 310
CPI 2024: 320
Inflation = (320 - 310) / 310 × 100% = 3.2%
```

**What This Means:**

- Fed's target: 2% inflation (stable, predictable)
- 0% inflation: Prices stable (no inflation)
- Negative inflation: **Deflation** (prices falling - sounds good but often indicates recession)
- 5%+ inflation: High inflation (erodes purchasing power quickly)
- 10%+ inflation: Very high inflation (economic instability)

---

### Inflation's Impact on You

**Example: $50,000 Salary**

**At 2% inflation (Fed's target):**
- Year 1: $50,000
- Year 5: Need $55,204 to maintain same purchasing power
- Year 10: Need $60,950
- Year 30: Need $90,568

**At 5% inflation (high):**
- Year 1: $50,000
- Year 5: Need $63,814
- Year 10: Need $81,445
- Year 30: Need $216,097

**Key Insight:** Your salary must GROW just to maintain same standard of living. If salary grows slower than inflation, you're getting POORER even though number is bigger.

**Real vs. Nominal Values:**

**Nominal** = Dollar amount, not adjusted for inflation
**Real** = Adjusted for inflation, shows true purchasing power

```
Real Value = Nominal Value / (1 + Inflation Rate)^Years

Example:
Your parents earned $30,000 in 1990
Inflation averaged 3%/year since then (34 years)
Real value today = $30,000 × (1.03)^34 = $81,621

Their $30,000 then = $81,621 today in purchasing power
```

## Causes of Inflation

Three main causes:

---

### 1. Demand-Pull Inflation

**"Too much money chasing too few goods"**

**What happens:**
- Aggregate demand increases (people want to buy more)
- Supply can't keep up
- Prices rise

**Causes of increased demand:**
- Economic boom (people confident, spending more)
- Government stimulus (fiscal policy - L-53)
- Low interest rates (monetary policy - L-53)
- Population growth
- Increased exports

**Example: 2021-2022 Inflation**
- COVID stimulus: $5 trillion spent
- Consumers had extra money (stimulus checks, unemployment)
- Spent on goods (homes, cars, appliances)
- Supply couldn't keep up (factories closed during COVID)
- Result: 8.5% inflation (highest in 40 years)

**Diagram:**

```
Aggregate Demand ↑
    ↓
More Spending on Same Goods
    ↓
Shortage at Current Prices
    ↓
Prices Rise
    ↓
INFLATION
```

**Policy Response:**
- Fed raises interest rates (contractionary monetary policy)
- Reduces demand
- Lowers inflation

---

### 2. Cost-Push Inflation

**"Production costs increase, businesses pass costs to consumers"**

**What happens:**
- Costs of production rise (wages, raw materials, energy)
- Businesses raise prices to maintain profits
- Prices rise economy-wide

**Causes:**
- Oil price shocks (energy more expensive → everything more expensive)
- Supply chain disruptions
- Natural disasters
- Rising wages
- Government regulations increasing compliance costs

**Example: 1970s Oil Crisis**
- OPEC oil embargo → oil prices quadrupled
- Everything uses energy (manufacturing, transportation)
- Prices rose across economy
- Result: 14% inflation

**Example: 2022 Russia-Ukraine War**
- Russia supplies ~10% of world oil
- War → sanctions → oil supply reduced
- Gas prices spiked to $5/gallon
- Contributed to inflation

**Diagram:**

```
Production Costs ↑ (oil, wages, materials)
    ↓
Businesses' Profit Margins Squeezed
    ↓
Businesses Raise Prices
    ↓
Consumers Pay More
    ↓
INFLATION
```

**Policy Challenge:**
- Cost-push inflation is HARD to fight
- Raising interest rates doesn't fix supply problems
- May cause recession without lowering inflation

---

### 3. Monetary Inflation

**"Too much money in the economy"**

**What happens:**
- Money supply grows faster than economic output
- Each dollar worth less
- Prices rise

**Causes:**
- Central bank prints too much money
- Excessive credit creation by banks
- Government deficit spending financed by printing money

**Example: Hyperinflation**

**Zimbabwe (2008):**
- Government printed money to pay debts
- Inflation hit 79.6 BILLION percent per month
- Prices doubled every 24 hours
- Currency became worthless

**Venezuela (2018):**
- Government printed money to fund spending
- Inflation hit 1,000,000% per year
- People used wheelbarrows of cash to buy bread

**Why This Doesn't Happen in US:**
- Federal Reserve is independent
- Doesn't print money to fund government directly
- Targets 2% inflation
- Credible commitment to price stability

**Diagram:**

```
Money Supply ↑ Faster than GDP Growth
    ↓
More Dollars Competing for Same Goods
    ↓
Each Dollar Worth Less
    ↓
Prices Rise
    ↓
INFLATION
```

### Inflation Summary

**Most inflation is COMBINATION:**

**2021-2022 Inflation:**
- **Demand-pull:** $5T stimulus → consumers spending more
- **Cost-push:** Supply chain disruptions, Russia-Ukraine war → oil prices up
- **Monetary:** Fed kept rates at 0% for 2 years → easy money

**Result:** 8.5% inflation peak

**Fed Response:**
- Raised rates from 0% to 5.5%
- Reduced demand
- Inflation fell to 3.1% (2024)

---

## What is Unemployment?

**Unemployment Rate** = Percentage of labor force actively looking for work but can't find jobs

**Formula:**

```
Unemployment Rate = (Unemployed / Labor Force) × 100%

Labor Force = Employed + Unemployed (looking for work)
NOT in labor force: Retirees, students, stay-at-home parents (not looking for work)
```

**Example:**
- Labor Force: 160 million
- Employed: 154 million
- Unemployed (looking): 6 million
- Unemployment Rate: 6/160 × 100% = 3.75%

**Current (2024):** US unemployment ~3.7%, {{STATE_NAME}} ~[{{STATE_UNEMPLOYMENT_RATE}}]%

---

### Types of Unemployment

---

#### 1. Frictional Unemployment

**Definition:** Temporary unemployment while transitioning between jobs

**Characteristics:**
- Short-term (weeks to months)
- Voluntary (quit to find better job)
- Healthy part of economy (people seeking better matches)

**Examples:**
- Recent college graduate job searching
- Worker quit job to find better opportunity
- Moved to new city, searching for job
- Seasonal worker between seasons

**How Long:** Typically 1-3 months

**Is This Bad?**
- NO - this is normal and healthy
- Shows dynamic economy with job mobility
- People improving their situations

**Can Government Reduce It?**
- Somewhat: Better job search resources, training programs
- But you can't eliminate it (will always be some friction)

**Affects You:**
- When you graduate, you'll be frictionally unemployed during job search
- Normal to take 2-4 months to find first job
- Don't panic - this is expected

---

#### 2. Structural Unemployment

**Definition:** Skills don't match available jobs (mismatch between workers and job requirements)

**Characteristics:**
- Longer-term (months to years)
- Due to technological change, globalization, industry decline
- Requires retraining or relocation

**Examples:**
- Coal miner in {{STATE_NAME}} when coal industry declines
- Factory worker replaced by automation/robots
- Travel agent when people book online
- Retail clerk when stores close due to e-commerce
- Switchboard operator when automated systems replace them

**How Long:** Can be months or years (need to retrain)

**Is This Bad?**
- YES for affected workers (painful transition)
- But often result of economic progress (automation increases productivity)

**Can Government Reduce It?**
- YES: Job retraining programs, education subsidies, relocation assistance
- But can't stop technological progress

**Example: Decline of Coal in {{STATE_NAME}}**
- Coal mining was major employer
- Renewable energy, natural gas replacing coal
- Coal miners structurally unemployed
- Solutions:
  - Retraining for renewable energy jobs
  - Relocation assistance
  - Community college programs
- Transition is HARD but necessary

**Affects You:**
- Your job may not exist in 20 years (AI, automation)
- Must continuously update skills
- Lifelong learning required
- Choose career fields with future demand

---

#### 3. Cyclical Unemployment

**Definition:** Unemployment due to economic recession/downturn

**Characteristics:**
- Economy-wide (affects all industries)
- Related to business cycle
- Temporary (until economy recovers)

**Causes:**
- Recession (GDP falling, demand low)
- Financial crisis
- Economic shock (COVID-19, 2008 housing crash)

**Examples:**
- 2008 Great Recession: Unemployment rose to 10%
- 2020 COVID: Unemployment hit 14.7%
- 1930s Great Depression: 25% unemployment

**How Long:** Until recession ends (6 months to years)

**Is This Bad?**
- YES - people lose jobs through no fault of their own
- Economy operating below potential
- Waste of resources

**Can Government Reduce It?**
- **YES** - This is what fiscal and monetary policy are for (L-53)
- Expansionary policy: Lower interest rates, government spending
- Goal: Stimulate demand, create jobs

**Affects You:**
- Graduating during recession = harder to find job
- "Unlucky" cohort may have lower lifetime earnings
- Timing matters (luck + preparation)

---

### Natural Rate of Unemployment

**Natural Rate (NAIRU)** = Unemployment rate when economy at full employment

**Includes:**
- Frictional unemployment (people between jobs)
- Structural unemployment (skills mismatch)

**Does NOT include:**
- Cyclical unemployment (recession-related)

**Current Estimate:** ~4-5% for US

**Key Insight:**
- Zero unemployment is IMPOSSIBLE and UNDESIRABLE
- Always some frictional (people transitioning)
- Always some structural (skills evolving)
- 4-5% unemployment = "Full employment"

**Why Can't We Go Lower?**
- Below natural rate → Labor shortage → Wages rise rapidly → Inflation
- Fed must balance: Too low unemployment → Inflation

---

## The Phillips Curve: Inflation vs. Unemployment Trade-Off

**Phillips Curve** = Inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment

**The Trade-Off:**

```
Low Unemployment ←→ High Inflation
High Unemployment ←→ Low Inflation
```

**Why This Trade-Off Exists:**

**Scenario 1: Economy Booming**
- Low unemployment (everyone has job)
- Labor shortage → Wages rise
- Businesses pass higher costs to consumers
- **Result:** Low unemployment BUT high inflation

**Scenario 2: Economy in Recession**
- High unemployment (people can't find jobs)
- Labor surplus → Wages stagnant or falling
- Low demand → Prices stable or falling
- **Result:** High unemployment BUT low inflation

**The Fed's Dilemma:**

**Can't achieve BOTH low unemployment AND low inflation simultaneously**
- Fight inflation (raise rates) → Higher unemployment
- Fight unemployment (lower rates) → Higher inflation
- Must BALANCE

**Graph:**

```
Inflation
    ↑
    |     ●  (High inflation, low unemployment)
    |
    |   ●  (Moderate both)
    |
    | ●  (Low inflation, high unemployment)
    |________________________→ Unemployment
    0%                        10%
```

---

### Stagflation: When the Phillips Curve Breaks

**Stagflation** = High inflation AND high unemployment (worst of both worlds)

**Shouldn't Be Possible:**
- Phillips Curve says: Can't have both high
- But 1970s proved it CAN happen

**1970s Stagflation:**
- Unemployment: 7-9%
- Inflation: 10-14%
- Economy stagnant (low growth)
- People called it "misery index" = Unemployment + Inflation

**Causes:**
- Oil price shocks (cost-push inflation)
- Loose monetary policy (too much money)
- Expectations: People expected inflation, demanded higher wages

**Why Is This So Bad?**

**Normal recession:** High unemployment but low inflation
- Fix: Stimulate economy (lower rates, government spending)
- No downside (inflation already low)

**Normal boom:** Low unemployment but high inflation
- Fix: Cool economy (raise rates, cut spending)
- Worth it (people have jobs)

**Stagflation:** High BOTH
- Fix inflation? → Raise rates → Even MORE unemployment
- Fix unemployment? → Lower rates → Even MORE inflation
- **No good option**

**How 1970s Ended:**
- Fed Chair Paul Volcker (1979-1987)
- Raised interest rates to 20% (!)
- Caused severe recession (unemployment 10%)
- But broke inflation (fell from 14% to 3%)
- **Painful but necessary**

**Lesson:** Don't let inflation get out of control, or the cure is worse than the disease.

---

## Current Economic Conditions (2024)

**US Economy:**
- Unemployment: ~3.7% (near natural rate)
- Inflation: ~3.1% (above Fed's 2% target, but falling from 8.5% peak)
- GDP growth: ~2.5% (healthy)
- Federal funds rate: 5.5% (Fed fighting inflation)

**{{STATE_NAME}}:**
- Unemployment: ~{{STATE_UNEMPLOYMENT_RATE}}%
- Major industries: [STATE_SPECIFIC]
- Economic conditions: [STATE_SPECIFIC]

**Fed's Current Challenge:**
- Inflation still above target (3.1% vs. 2% goal)
- But unemployment low (don't want to cause recession)
- Goal: "Soft landing" (reduce inflation without raising unemployment)
- So far succeeding (but not finished)

**What This Means for You:**
- Job market strong (easy to find work)
- But prices still rising (salary needs to keep up)
- Interest rates high (expensive to borrow)
- Savings rates good (earn more on savings)

## Discussion Questions

1. **Inflation vs. Unemployment:** If you had to choose, would you rather live in economy with:
   - 2% inflation, 7% unemployment, OR
   - 7% inflation, 2% unemployment?
   - Which is worse for you personally?

2. **Graduating During Recession:** Class of 2009 graduated during Great Recession (10% unemployment)
   - Should they have delayed graduation?
   - Should government have done more to create jobs?
   - Is it fair some cohorts face worse job markets?

3. **Technological Unemployment:** AI and automation are replacing jobs
   - Cashiers, truck drivers, customer service reps
   - Should government slow technological change to protect jobs?
   - Or embrace change and retrain workers?

4. **Fed's Dilemma:** 2022-2023, Fed raised rates to fight inflation
   - Risk: Could cause recession
   - But: Inflation at 8.5% was unsustainable
   - Did Fed make right call?

5. **{{STATE_NAME}} Specific:** How do inflation and unemployment affect your community?
   - What industries are vulnerable to economic downturns?
   - How has recent inflation affected your family?
