## Detailed Facilitation Guide

### Opening Reflection (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Prime students to think about their own purchases and market power

**Facilitation Steps:**
1. Display prompt: "What are your three biggest monthly expenses?"
2. Set timer for 3 minutes silent writing
3. Questions on board:
   - "How many provider options do you have?"
   - "How much pricing power do sellers have?"
   - "Where do you have least control?"

**Do NOT:**
- Share publicly (expenses are personal)
- Judge choices

**Monitoring:**
- Circulate to see what students identify
- Note common expenses for later discussion

**Transition:** "Today you'll analyze these purchases and develop strategies to get better value"

### Activity 1: Market Structure Identification (15 minutes)

**Objective:** Students classify their actual purchases by market structure

**Facilitation Steps:**

**Introduction (2 minutes):**
1. "Complete the table for 10 regular purchases"
2. "For each, identify: # of options, differentiation, market structure"
3. "Then calculate how much goes to non-competitive markets"

**Independent Work (10 minutes):**
1. Students work individually on classification
2. Set timer
3. Circulate and monitor

**Common Student Errors:**
- Confusing monopoly with oligopoly (3 options ≠ 1 option)
- Classifying all big companies as monopolies
- Missing product differentiation

**Coaching Questions:**
- "How many realistic options do you have?"
- "Can you switch easily?"
- "Are products truly different or just marketed as different?"

**Part B: Analysis Questions (3 minutes):**
Students answer questions about where they have power/don't have power

**Key Insights to Highlight:**
- "Most people spend 30-50% of budget in non-competitive markets"
- "This is where seller captures most surplus"
- "These are hardest expenses to reduce"

**Class Debrief (3 minutes):**
1. "Quick poll: How many spend >50% in monopoly/oligopoly markets?"
2. "What's your biggest monopoly expense?" (Usually utilities)
3. "What's your biggest oligopoly expense?" (Usually phone/internet)

**Connection to Previous Learning:**
"Remember L-50 consumer surplus? In competitive markets, you keep most surplus. In monopolies, seller captures it."

### Activity 2: Consumer Strategy Development (20 minutes)

**Objective:** Create specific, actionable strategies for each market structure

**Setup:**
Students work individually, then compare with partner

**Facilitation Steps:**

**Introduction (2 minutes):**
1. "Different markets require different strategies"
2. "We'll develop specific tactics for each structure"
3. "Then calculate total expected savings"

**Strategy 1: Perfect Competition (4 minutes)**

**Facilitate:**
- "In perfectly competitive markets, shop by price alone"
- "Products are identical, so lowest price wins"

**Example to Share:**
- Generic medication: Advil (brand) $12 vs. Ibuprofen (generic) $4
- Same active ingredient, same dosage, 70% savings

**Student Work:**
- Identify one perfectly competitive purchase
- Plan how to save
- Estimate savings

**Strategy 2: Monopolistic Competition (4 minutes)**

**Facilitate:**
- "Many options, so shop around"
- "Decide what YOU value, not what ads tell you"
- "Brand premium: worth it or not?"

**Example to Share:**
Coffee comparison:
- Starbucks $5: Paying for brand, atmosphere, consistency
- Local cafe $4: Paying for quality, community
- Home $0.50: Same caffeine

"Which is right depends on what you value. But be conscious of the choice."

**Student Work:**
- Identify one monopolistically competitive purchase where paying for differentiation they don't need
- Find alternative
- Estimate savings

**Strategy 3: Oligopoly (6 minutes)**

**Facilitate:**
- "Only 3-5 options, so compare them ALL"
- "Biggest opportunity: Negotiate at renewal"

**Negotiation Script (share with class):**
```
"Hi, I've been a customer for [X years]. I see [Competitor]
offers [specific plan] for $[Y] less. I'd prefer to stay
with you—what can you offer?"
```

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Call retention department (most power to negotiate)
- Be ready to actually switch
- Best time: contract renewal or when competitor has promotion
- Have specific competitor offer in hand

**Real-World Example:**
"Cell phone bills: Industry average is $50/month per line. But if you negotiate yearly, can often get to $35-40/month."

**Student Work:**
- Identify oligopoly service to negotiate
- Research competitor offers
- Plan negotiation approach
- Estimate savings

**Monitor and Coach:**
- Are students identifying realistic competitors?
- Do they have specific offers to use as leverage?
- Are savings estimates reasonable?

**Strategy 4: Monopoly (4 minutes)**

**Facilitate:**
- "Can't change price, so reduce consumption"
- "Look for long-term substitutes"

**Example to Share:**
Electricity monopoly:
- Can't switch providers
- But can: LED bulbs, adjust thermostat, unplug vampires, solar panels (long-term)
- 15-20% usage reduction = 15-20% cost reduction

**Student Work:**
- Identify monopoly service
- Plan consumption reduction
- Estimate savings

**Partner Comparison (2 minutes):**
1. "Share your strategies with partner"
2. "Discuss: Which will save most? Which is easiest to implement?"

**Whole Class (1 minute):**
- "Who calculated savings over $500/year?"
- "What's the biggest single saving opportunity?" (Usually negotiating oligopoly services)

**Key Teaching Moment:**
"These aren't just theoretical exercises. Students who actually negotiate their phone bills save $100-200/year. Over 10 years, that's $1,000-2,000+ with compound interest."

### Activity 3: {{STATE_NAME}} Industry Analysis (10 minutes)

**Objective:** Analyze local industries by market structure

**Facilitation Steps:**

**Introduction (2 minutes):**
1. "{{STATE_NAME}} has all four market structures"
2. "Let's classify major industries and understand regulation"

**Part A: Industry Classification (4 minutes)**

**Facilitate:**
- Students complete table for {{STATE_NAME}} industries
- Use their own knowledge + quick research if needed

**Provide Guidance:**
- Utilities: Monopoly (electric, gas, water)
- Telecom: Oligopoly ({{STATE_TELECOM_PROVIDERS}})
- Healthcare: Varies (oligopoly in many areas, monopoly in rural areas)
- Retail: Monopolistic competition
- Banking: Oligopoly nationally, monopolistic competition locally

**Part B: Regulation Analysis (4 minutes)**

**Key Discussion Questions:**
1. "Which industries are regulated in {{STATE_NAME}}? Why?"
   - Utilities: Natural monopoly
   - Healthcare: Quality/safety, information asymmetry
   - Banking: Financial stability

2. "Has regulation helped or hurt consumers?"
   - Helped: Safe utilities, inspected food, licensed professionals
   - Hurt: Sometimes higher costs, less innovation, barriers to entry

3. "Where should {{STATE_NAME}} regulate more? Less?"
   - This is debatable - encourage students to support positions with evidence

**Facilitate Debate:**
- Take 1-2 students arguing for more regulation
- Take 1-2 arguing for less
- Guide toward: "It's a balance. Regulate when market failure, deregulate when competition works."

**Connection to L-52 Preview:**
"Tomorrow we'll dive deeper into when and how government should intervene in markets"

### Activity 4: Market Structure Identifier Tool (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Use decision tree to systematically identify structures

**Facilitation Steps:**

**Introduction (1 minute):**
1. "Here's a systematic tool for any purchase"
2. "Follow decision tree to classify"

**Independent Work (3 minutes):**
1. Students choose 2-3 purchases to analyze
2. Use decision tree from student content
3. Classify and develop strategy

**No Whole-Class Sharing:**
- Students submit completed analyses
- Use as assessment

**Circulate and Monitor:**
- Are students following decision tree correctly?
- Are classifications accurate?
- Are strategies aligned with structure?

**Assessment Rubric:**
- Correct classification (40%)
- Appropriate strategy (40%)
- Realistic savings estimate (20%)

---

## Closing Activity: Action Plan (included in Activity 2)

**Students created action plans during Activity 2**

**Briefly review:**
1. "Total monthly savings from all strategies?"
2. "Which will you implement first?"
3. "Timeline for implementation?"

**Encourage follow-through:**
- "Set phone reminder to negotiate cell bill"
- "Try generic medication next time at pharmacy"
- "Research competitor offers this week"

**Preview L-52:**
"Tomorrow: Government's role in economy. When markets fail, when government should intervene, how regulation affects you"

---

## Differentiation Strategies

**For Struggling Students:**
- Provide partially completed tables
- Focus on 1-2 strategies rather than all four
- Pair with stronger student for peer review
- Provide specific examples of each strategy

**For Advanced Students:**
- Calculate lifetime value of savings (compounding)
- Research specific {{STATE_NAME}} regulations and analyze costs/benefits
- Create detailed negotiation plan with multiple scenarios
- Analyze market structure changes over time (how industries consolidate)

**For ELL Students:**
- Provide sentence frames for analysis
- Allow use of translation tools
- Pair with bilingual peer
- Provide visual examples of each strategy

---

## Assessment

**Formative (During Class):**
- Circulation monitoring during activities
- Partner discussions quality
- Question depth during {{STATE_NAME}} analysis

**Summative:**
**Option 1: Completed Action Plan**
- Rubric:
  - Market structure identification (25%)
  - Strategy appropriateness (25%)
  - Savings estimates (20%)
  - Implementation plan (20%)
  - Overall completeness (10%)

**Option 2: Market Structure Analysis Portfolio**
- Students analyze 5 purchases
- For each: Structure, evidence, strategy, expected savings
- Submit as written report or presentation

---

## Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1: Students overestimate savings**
- **Solution:** Help them be realistic. Negotiating may save $10-20/month, not $100/month

**Challenge 2: "I don't pay these bills, my parents do"**
- **Solution:** "Practice the analysis now. When you pay your own bills, you'll be ready. Also, share strategies with parents!"

**Challenge 3: Students don't believe negotiation works**
- **Solution:** Share real examples, have them role-play, emphasize retention department's power

**Challenge 4: Debate over regulation becomes too political**
- **Solution:** Refocus on economic analysis (costs vs. benefits), not political ideology

**Challenge 5: Wide variation in completion pace**
- **Solution:** Have extension questions ready, allow fast finishers to help others

## Connection to Day 1

Reference yesterday's concepts:
- "Remember the four structures from yesterday?"
- "Perfect competition = price taker. Today you're identifying where you face price takers vs. price makers"
- "Barriers to entry create market power. That's why your electric company charges what it does"

---

## Notes for Next Year

- **Activity 2 timing:** Students need full 20 minutes for strategy development
- **Negotiation scripts:** Provide more specific examples for different services
- **{{STATE_NAME}} data:** Update annually (providers consolidate, regulations change)
- **Success stories:** Collect student examples of successful negotiations to share in future years
- **Technology:** Consider creating online calculator for savings estimation

## Tomorrow's Preparation

**L-52: Government and the Economy - Personal Impact**

Preview for yourself:
- Market failures (externalities, public goods, information asymmetry)
- Government interventions (taxes, subsidies, regulation, antitrust)
- {{STATE_NAME}} and federal policies affecting students
- Public vs. private provision

Be ready to reference:
- "L-51 showed when markets have limited competition. L-52 shows what government does about it"
- "Monopolies from yesterday are one reason for regulation"
