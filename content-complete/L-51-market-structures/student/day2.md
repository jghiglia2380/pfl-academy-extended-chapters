## Day 2: Consumer Strategies Across Market Structures - Learning Lab

### Learning Objectives
By the end of today's Learning Lab, you will be able to:
- Evaluate consumer strategies for maximizing value in different market structures
- Apply understanding of market power to negotiate better deals
- Analyze {{STATE_NAME}} industries by market structure
- Assess when government intervention in markets may be justified

---

## Opening Reflection (5 minutes)

**Write:** Think about your three biggest monthly expenses (rent, food, phone, transportation, etc.)

**Questions:**
- For each expense, how many provider options do you have?
- How much pricing power do the sellers have?
- How much negotiating power do YOU have?
- Which expenses give you the least control over price?

Keep these in mind as we develop strategies for each market structure today.

## Learning Lab Activities

### Activity 1: Market Structure Identification (15 minutes)

**Objective:** Classify real purchases by market structure and understand implications

#### Part A: Your Personal Purchases (8 minutes)

**Complete the analysis for 10 regular purchases:**

| Purchase/Service | # of Realistic Options | Product Differentiation? | Can You Negotiate? | Market Structure | Your Power (Low/Med/High) |
|-----------------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| **Example: Cell phone plan** | 3-4 (AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, MVNO) | Slightly different | Yes (when switching) | Oligopoly | Medium |
| 1. Electricity | | | | | |
| 2. Internet service | | | | | |
| 3. Groceries (store) | | | | | |
| 4. Gasoline | | | | | |
| 5. Streaming (Netflix, etc.) | | | | | |
| 6. Restaurant meals | | | | | |
| 7. Clothing | | | | | |
| 8. Car insurance | | | | | |
| 9. Banking services | | | | | |
| 10. Water/sewer | | | | | |

**For each, ask:**
- How many sellers? (Many = competition, Few = oligopoly, One = monopoly)
- Are products differentiated? (Identical = perfect competition, Different = monopolistic)
- Can you negotiate price? (Power indicator)

#### Part B: Analysis Questions (7 minutes)

1. **Which purchases have monopoly or oligopoly structure?**
   - List: _______________________
   - **Question:** How much do these cost per month total? $_______
   - **Insight:** Where sellers have power, you pay more

2. **Which purchases have monopolistic or perfect competition?**
   - List: _______________________
   - **Question:** Do you shop around for these? Why or why not?

3. **Where do you have the most negotiating power?**
   - Purchase: _______________________
   - **Why:** Many options, easy to switch, sellers compete for you

4. **Where do you have the least power?**
   - Purchase: _______________________
   - **Why:** Few or no alternatives, high switching costs, necessity

5. **Total monthly spending by market structure:**
   - Monopoly goods: $_______/month
   - Oligopoly goods: $_______/month
   - Monopolistic competition: $_______/month
   - Perfect competition: $_______/month

   **What percentage of your budget goes to non-competitive markets?** _______%

**Key Insight:** The less competitive the market, the more of your money goes to seller profits rather than actual production costs.

### Activity 2: Consumer Strategy Development (20 minutes)

**Objective:** Create specific strategies for maximizing value in each market structure

#### Strategy 1: Perfect Competition (5 minutes)

**Characteristics:** Many sellers, identical products, low prices

**Your Strategy:**

**When buying in perfectly competitive markets:**

1. **Shop by price alone:**
   - Products are identical, so pay the lowest price
   - Example: Gas - use GasBuddy app to find cheapest station
   - Example: Stock market - all brokers sell same stock, choose lowest commission

2. **Don't pay for branding:**
   - Generic = brand name in perfect competition
   - Example: Ibuprofen - generic is chemically identical to Advil, costs 70% less

3. **Use price comparison tools:**
   - Online shopping for commodities
   - Farmer's markets (compare stands)

**Examples to practice:**

| Purchase | Perfectly Competitive? | Strategy |
|----------|----------------------|----------|
| Gasoline | Yes (locally) | Use app to find cheapest station within 2 miles |
| Generic medication | Yes | Buy store brand, not name brand |
| Produce at farmers market | Often yes | Compare prices, buy from cheapest |

**Your Action Plan:**
- One perfectly competitive purchase I'll change strategy on: _______________________
- How I'll save: _______________________
- Expected monthly savings: $_______

#### Strategy 2: Monopolistic Competition (5 minutes)

**Characteristics:** Many sellers, differentiated products, some pricing power

**Your Strategy:**

**When buying in monopolistically competitive markets:**

1. **Decide what you value:**
   - Brand? Quality? Convenience? Atmosphere?
   - Pay for what YOU value, not what ads tell you to

2. **Ignore marketing hype:**
   - Ads create perceived differentiation that may not exist
   - Example: Bottled water brands - mostly identical product, wildly different prices

3. **Try alternatives regularly:**
   - Your "favorite" may be habit, not actual preference
   - Example: Try different coffee shops monthly, reassess if Starbucks premium is worth it

4. **Negotiate when possible:**
   - Gyms, salons, and service providers often negotiate
   - "What's your best price?" or "Do you price match?"

5. **Shop sales but avoid false urgency:**
   - Many sellers means sales happen frequently
   - "One-day only" sales repeat monthly

**Examples to practice:**

| Purchase | Differentiation | What I Actually Value | Am I Overpaying? |
|----------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Coffee shop | Brand, location, atmosphere | Caffeine + workspace | Maybe - could try local cafe |
| Clothing | Brand, style, quality | Durability, fit | Maybe - could try outlet stores |
| Gym | Equipment, classes, location | Proximity, hours | Probably fine - location worth premium |

**Your Action Plan:**
- One monopolistically competitive purchase where I'm paying for differentiation I don't need: _______________________
- Alternative I'll try: _______________________
- Expected savings: $_______/month

#### Strategy 3: Oligopoly (5 minutes)

**Characteristics:** Few sellers (3-10), high barriers, prices similar across firms

**Your Strategy:**

**When buying in oligopolistic markets:**

1. **Compare ALL major players:**
   - Only 3-5 options, so compare them all thoroughly
   - Example: Cell phone plans - build comparison spreadsheet of AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile

2. **Negotiate at contract renewal:**
   - Firms fight to keep you (losing customer = gain for competitor)
   - Call retention department: "I'm considering switching to [competitor]. What can you offer?"
   - Be prepared to actually switch if they don't negotiate

3. **Bundle when beneficial:**
   - Oligopolies often offer multiple services
   - Bundle if you actually need all services, but don't add unnecessary ones just for "discount"

4. **Watch for price coordination:**
   - If all firms raise prices simultaneously, it may be tacit collusion
   - Example: All airlines adding baggage fees at same time

5. **Time purchases for competitive periods:**
   - Sign up when companies are actively competing for customers
   - Example: Back-to-school phone promotions, airline sales during slow periods

**Examples to practice:**

| Oligopoly Service | Current Provider | Competitor Offers | Negotiation Result |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Cell phone ({{STATE_NAME}}) | _____________ | Check other 2-3 carriers | Call for better rate or switch |
| Car insurance | _____________ | Get quotes from 3+ companies | May save 10-20% by switching |
| Internet | _____________ | Limited options in area | Negotiate or accept monopoly pricing |

**Your Negotiation Script:**

"Hi, I've been a customer for [X years], but I'm seeing [Competitor] offers [specific plan] for $[Y] less per month. I'd prefer to stay with you—what can you offer to match or beat that?"

**Your Action Plan:**
- Oligopoly service I'll negotiate: _______________________
- Competitor offer I'll use as leverage: _______________________
- Target savings: $_______/month

#### Strategy 4: Monopoly (5 minutes)

**Characteristics:** One seller, no substitutes, maximum pricing power

**Your Strategy:**

**When forced to buy from monopolies:**

1. **Minimize consumption:**
   - You can't change the price, but you can buy less
   - Example: Electricity - energy efficiency, time-of-use pricing
   - Example: Water - conservation, low-flow fixtures

2. **Understand rate structures:**
   - Monopolies often have tiered pricing
   - First X units cheaper, then price increases
   - Avoid high-cost tiers

3. **Look for long-term substitutes:**
   - Can't switch today, but can reduce dependence over time
   - Example: Cable monopoly → Streaming
   - Example: Electricity monopoly → Solar panels

4. **Advocate for regulation:**
   - Monopolies should be regulated by government
   - Attend public utility commission hearings if rates are unfair
   - Support policies that enable competition when possible

5. **Bundle if monopolist offers multiple services:**
   - Sometimes get discount for water + sewer, or electricity + gas

**Examples to practice:**

| Monopoly Service | Current Cost | Consumption Reduction Strategy | Estimated Savings |
|------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| Electricity ({{STATE_UTILITY_PROVIDERS}}) | $_____/month | LED bulbs, unplug vampires, adjust thermostat | $___/month |
| Water | $_____/month | Low-flow showerhead, fix leaks, shorter showers | $___/month |
| Cable (if no alternatives) | $_____/month | Cut cable, switch to streaming | $___/month |

**Your Action Plan:**
- Monopoly service where I'll reduce consumption: _______________________
- Specific action: _______________________
- Expected savings: $_______/month

**Total Expected Savings from All Strategies:** $_______/month = $_______/year

| **Utilities (electric, gas, water)** | | | |
| **Telecommunications** | | | |
| **Healthcare (hospitals)** | | | |
| **Banking** | | | |
| **Retail (groceries, clothing)** | | | |
| **Restaurants** | | | |
| **Insurance (auto, health, home)** | | | |
| **Higher education** | | | |

**Guiding Questions:**
- How many major players in {{STATE_NAME}}?
- Can new competitors easily enter?
- How much do prices vary between providers?
- Do consumers have real choices?

#### Part B: Government Intervention Analysis (5 minutes)

**Which {{STATE_NAME}} industries are regulated? Why?**

| Industry | Regulated? | Type of Regulation | Justification |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Electricity | Yes | Price regulation by Public Utility Commission | Natural monopoly |
| Cell phones | Partially | FCC licensing, antitrust | Limited spectrum, oligopoly |
| Healthcare | Heavily | Licensing, insurance regulation, safety | Quality/safety, information asymmetry |
| Restaurants | Moderately | Health inspections, labor laws | Public safety |

**Discussion:**
1. **Should {{STATE_NAME}} regulate more industries or fewer?**
   - More regulation when: Natural monopoly, market failure, public safety
   - Less regulation when: Competitive markets work well, regulation creates inefficiency

2. **Has regulation helped or hurt you as a consumer?**
   - Helped: Safe electricity, clean water, inspected food
   - Hurt: Higher costs in some cases, less choice

3. **Where does {{STATE_NAME}} have too much regulation? Too little?**
   - Debate: Housing (zoning restrictions limit supply, raise prices)
   - Debate: Telecom (limited competition, high prices)
   - Your opinion: _______________________

### Activity 4: Market Structure Identifier Tool (Skill Builder) (10 minutes)

**Objective:** Use systematic framework to identify market structures

**For any purchase, use this decision tree:**

#### Step 1: How many sellers?
- **One** → Likely MONOPOLY → Proceed to Step 2a
- **Few (2-10)** → Likely OLIGOPOLY → Proceed to Step 2b
- **Many (dozens+)** → Proceed to Step 2c

#### Step 2a: Monopoly Verification
- **Is there truly no substitute?**
  - Yes → MONOPOLY
  - No → Redefine market more broadly
- **Why does monopoly exist?**
  - Natural monopoly (infrastructure)
  - Legal monopoly (patent, license)
  - Market power (dominance)

**Your Strategy:** Minimize consumption, seek long-term alternatives

#### Step 2b: Oligopoly Verification
- **Are there high barriers to entry?**
  - Yes → OLIGOPOLY
  - No → Probably monopolistic competition with consolidation
- **Do firms' prices move together?**
  - Yes → OLIGOPOLY (price coordination)
  - No → Might be monopolistic competition

**Your Strategy:** Compare all options, negotiate, watch for collusion

#### Step 2c: Many Sellers - Which Type?
- **Are products identical or nearly identical?**
  - Identical → PERFECT COMPETITION
    - **Your Strategy:** Buy the cheapest
  - Differentiated → MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION
    - **Your Strategy:** Assess if differentiation is worth price premium

#### Practice: Analyze These Purchases

**Purchase 1: Smartphone**
- Step 1: Few sellers (Apple, Samsung, Google dominate)
- Step 2b: High barriers (R&D costs, patents, brand), prices high but competitive
- **Classification:** OLIGOPOLY
- **Strategy:** Compare all major brands, negotiate with carrier, consider previous generation model

**Purchase 2: _______________ (Your Choice)**
- Step 1: How many sellers? _______
- Step 2: _______________________________
- **Classification:** _______________________
- **Strategy:** _______________________

**Purchase 3: _______________ (Your Choice)**
- Step 1: _______________________________
- Step 2: _______________________________
- **Classification:** _______________________
- **Strategy:** _______________________
