## Opening: Why Does Netflix Cost What It Costs?

**Quick Exercise:** Compare these purchases:

1. **Gasoline:** All stations on the same corner charge nearly identical prices ($3.89, $3.91, $3.89)
2. **Smartphones:** Only 3 major options (Apple, Samsung, Google), prices set by manufacturers
3. **Electricity in {{STATE_NAME}}:** Usually one provider, you pay the rate they set
4. **Coffee shops:** Starbucks, local cafes, Dunkin' - similar products, different prices and experiences

**Question:** Why do some markets have lots of competition and similar prices, while others have few sellers with more pricing power?

**Answer:** Market structure - the number of sellers and degree of competition - determines how much power businesses have to set prices and how many choices you have as a consumer.

## Connecting to What You've Learned

**From L-48 (Economic Systems):**
- Market economies rely on **competition** to keep prices low and quality high
- {{STATE_NAME}}'s mixed economy: Most markets are competitive, but some are monopolies or oligopolies
- Competition creates incentives to serve customers well

**From L-49 (Scarcity and Opportunity Cost):**
- Scarcity creates markets
- **But market structure affects whether consumers or producers capture more surplus**
- Monopolies can create artificial scarcity (restrict output to raise prices)

**From L-50 (Supply and Demand):**
- In **competitive markets**, supply and demand determine prices
- In **non-competitive markets**, sellers have more power to set prices above competitive equilibrium
- Elasticity matters: Less elastic demand = more pricing power for sellers

**Today's New Concept:**
The number of sellers and level of competition creates four distinct **market structures**, each with different implications for your wallet and choices.

## The Four Market Structures

### Overview Table

| Market Structure | Number of Sellers | Product Type | Entry Barriers | Price Control | Examples |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| **Perfect Competition** | Many | Identical | None | None (price takers) | Agricultural commodities, stock market |
| **Monopolistic Competition** | Many | Differentiated | Low | Some (brand premium) | Restaurants, clothing, coffee shops |
| **Oligopoly** | Few (3-10) | Identical or differentiated | High | Significant (price leaders) | Airlines, cell phones, auto manufacturers |
| **Monopoly** | One | Unique | Very high | Maximum | Utilities, local cable, patented drugs |

**Key Insight:** As competition decreases (moving down the table), seller power increases and consumer surplus typically decreases.

---

## 1. Perfect Competition

**Definition:** A market with many small sellers, identical products, no barriers to entry, and no individual seller can influence price.

### Characteristics:

1. **Many Buyers and Sellers:** No single participant affects market price
2. **Identical (Homogeneous) Products:** One seller's product is indistinguishable from another's
3. **Perfect Information:** Buyers know all prices and product quality
4. **Free Entry and Exit:** Anyone can start selling with no barriers
5. **Price Takers:** Sellers must accept market price; raising price means zero sales

### Examples:

- **Agricultural markets:** Wheat, corn, soybeans (one farmer's wheat = any other farmer's wheat)
- **Stock market:** Shares of the same company are identical
- **Foreign currency exchange:** Dollars are dollars
- **Online commodity markets:** Generic bulk goods

### How It Works:

**Supply and Demand (from L-50) determine the market price:**
- If one farmer tries to charge more for wheat, buyers go elsewhere
- Farmers are "price takers" - they accept the market price or don't sell
- Any profit attracts new sellers → supply increases → price falls back to minimum sustainable level
- **Result:** Prices as low as possible while keeping sellers in business

### Consumer Impact:

**Advantages:**
- ✓ Lowest possible prices (competitive equilibrium)
- ✓ Efficient allocation of resources
- ✓ No excess profits for sellers (just enough to stay in business)

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ No product variety (all identical)
- ✗ Minimal customer service (sellers compete on price only)
- ✗ No innovation incentive (can't charge premium for better product)

### Personal Finance Application:

When buying commoditized goods (gas, basic groceries, generic products), shop by price alone. There's no quality difference between sellers in perfectly competitive markets.

---

## 2. Monopolistic Competition

**Definition:** A market with many sellers offering differentiated products with low barriers to entry.

### Characteristics:

1. **Many Sellers:** Lots of competition, but not perfect
2. **Product Differentiation:** Each seller's product is slightly different (quality, features, brand, location)
3. **Some Price Control:** Can charge different prices due to differentiation
4. **Low Entry Barriers:** Easy to start competing
5. **Non-Price Competition:** Compete on quality, service, branding, location

### Examples:

- **Restaurants:** Thousands of options, each different in cuisine, atmosphere, location
- **Coffee shops:** Starbucks vs. Dunkin' vs. local cafes - similar product, different experiences
- **Clothing stores:** Many brands, each with different styles and positioning
- **Hair salons:** Many salons, each with different stylists, services, atmosphere
- **Gyms in {{STATE_NAME}}:** Lots of options, differentiated by equipment, classes, location

### How It Works:

**Product differentiation creates small monopolies:**
- Starbucks has a "monopoly" on the Starbucks experience
- They can charge $5 for coffee that costs $0.50 to make
- But if they charge $20, people go to competitors
- **Result:** Some pricing power, but limited by substitutes

**Entry and Exit:**
- If restaurants are profitable in your area, new ones open → competition increases → prices stabilize
- If gyms struggle, some close → less competition → survivors can raise prices
- Long-run: Economic profit approaches zero (like perfect competition) but firms survive through differentiation

### Consumer Impact:

**Advantages:**
- ✓ Variety and choice (different products for different preferences)
- ✓ Competition keeps prices reasonable
- ✓ Customer service matters (differentiation)
- ✓ Innovation (sellers differentiate through new features)

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ Higher prices than perfect competition (brand premiums)
- ✗ Advertising costs passed to consumers
- ✗ Can be overwhelming (too many choices)

### Personal Finance Application:

In monopolistically competitive markets:
- Shop around - prices vary significantly
- Consider if brand premium is worth it to YOU
- Ignore marketing hype - focus on actual value
- Loyalty isn't always rewarded (switch if better deal exists)

**Example:** Coffee
- Starbucks: $5 for experience/brand/convenience
- Local cafe: $4 for quality/community
- Dunkin': $3 for speed/value
- Home-brewed: $0.50 for same caffeine

Choose based on what you value, but recognize you're paying for differentiation.

## 3. Oligopoly

**Definition:** A market dominated by a few large sellers with significant barriers to entry.

### Characteristics:

1. **Few Dominant Sellers:** Usually 3-10 firms control most of the market
2. **High Barriers to Entry:** Requires massive capital, technology, or regulatory approval
3. **Interdependence:** Each firm's decisions affect competitors (strategic behavior)
4. **Identical or Differentiated Products:** Can be either
5. **Significant Price Control:** Can maintain prices above competitive levels

### Examples:

- **Cell phone carriers:** AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile dominate
- **Airlines:** A few major carriers (Delta, United, American, Southwest)
- **Auto manufacturers:** Ford, GM, Toyota, Honda, etc. (but only ~10 major players)
- **Soft drinks:** Coca-Cola and PepsiCo control ~80% of market
- **Streaming services:** Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max (growing but still limited)

### How It Works:

**Strategic interdependence:**
- If Verizon lowers prices, AT&T and T-Mobile must respond
- If all three keep prices high, they all profit (tacit collusion)
- Difficult for new competitors to enter (need billions in infrastructure)
- **Result:** Prices higher than competitive markets, but lower than monopoly

**Price Leadership:**
- Often one firm (usually largest) sets prices
- Others follow to avoid price wars
- Example: If Delta raises baggage fees, United and American typically match

**Barriers to Entry:**
- Massive startup costs (building cell towers, buying aircraft)
- Brand loyalty (consumers trust established names)
- Economies of scale (large firms have lower per-unit costs)
- Government regulation (telecom licenses, airline routes)

### Consumer Impact:

**Advantages:**
- ✓ Stable prices (less volatile than perfect competition)
- ✓ Heavy investment in quality/innovation (firms compete on more than price)
- ✓ Economies of scale can lower costs
- ✓ Nationwide networks/services (airlines, telecoms)

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ Higher prices than competitive markets
- ✗ Limited choices (3-5 major options)
- ✗ Profits flow to large corporations, not consumers
- ✗ Potential for collusion (illegal but can happen subtly)

### Personal Finance Application:

In oligopolistic markets:
- **Compare all major players** - limited options but meaningful differences
- **Negotiate when possible** - especially in telecoms (they'd rather keep you than lose to competitor)
- **Watch for simultaneous price increases** - sign of coordination
- **Time purchases strategically** - competition may intensify during specific periods (airline sales, phone plan promotions)

**Example:** Cell Phones in {{STATE_NAME}}
- {{STATE_TELECOM_PROVIDERS}} dominate
- All charge similar prices for similar plans
- "Deals" often match competitors within weeks
- Strategy: Negotiate yearly, threaten to switch, bundle services

## 4. Monopoly

**Definition:** A market with a single seller and no close substitutes.

### Characteristics:

1. **One Seller:** Only source of product or service
2. **No Close Substitutes:** Consumers can't easily switch
3. **High Barriers to Entry:** Impossible or illegal for competitors to enter
4. **Price Maker:** Complete control over price (limited only by demand curve)
5. **Can Earn Long-Run Economic Profit:** No competition to drive profits to zero

### Types of Monopolies:

**Natural Monopoly:**
- One firm can supply entire market more efficiently than multiple firms
- Examples: Electricity, water, natural gas in {{STATE_NAME}}
- **Why:** Massive infrastructure costs make competition wasteful (imagine 3 sets of power lines to every house)
- **Government response:** Regulate prices

**Legal Monopoly:**
- Government grants exclusive right
- Examples: Patents (drugs), copyrights (books, movies), licenses
- **Why:** Encourage innovation (20-year patent protection) or control (professional licenses)
- **Time limit:** Usually expires after set period

**Market Power Monopoly:**
- Firm dominates through business practices
- Examples (historical): Standard Oil, AT&T before breakup
- Examples (current/debated): Google (search), Facebook (social), Amazon (e-commerce in some categories)
- **Government response:** Antitrust enforcement (break up or regulate)

### Examples:

- **{{STATE_NAME}} utility providers:** {{STATE_UTILITY_PROVIDERS}} (electricity, water, gas)
- **Local cable company:** Often only one provider in area
- **Patented prescription drugs:** Only company that can make specific medication for 20 years
- **Sports leagues:** NFL has monopoly on professional football
- **Your local water company**

### How It Works:

**Monopolist sets quantity to maximize profit:**
1. Face downward-sloping demand curve (unlike perfect competition)
2. Reduce output below competitive level
3. Charge price above competitive equilibrium
4. Earn economic profit indefinitely (no competition to eliminate it)

**Deadweight Loss:**
- Some consumers who would buy at competitive price can't afford monopoly price
- Society loses potential transactions (inefficient)
- This is why monopolies are generally bad for consumers

### Consumer Impact:

**Advantages:**
- ✓ Economies of scale (sometimes lower costs)
- ✓ Consistent service (no confusion about which provider)
- ✓ Stability (won't go out of business)

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ Highest prices (monopolist extracts maximum consumer surplus)
- ✗ No choice (take it or leave it)
- ✗ Minimal innovation (no competitive pressure)
- ✗ Poor customer service (where else will you go?)
- ✗ Deadweight loss (inefficient allocation)

### Personal Finance Application:

With monopolies:
- **No ability to shop around** - but check for:
  - Regulated rate structures (utilities often have tiered pricing)
  - Time-of-use pricing (electricity cheaper at night)
  - Conservation incentives (use less = pay less per unit)
- **Advocate for regulation** - monopolies should be regulated to protect consumers
- **Consider substitutes when possible:**
  - Cable monopoly → Streaming services
  - Landline monopoly → Cell phones
  - Patented drug → Wait for generic after patent expires
- **Bundle services if multiple monopolies exist** - sometimes get discounts

**Example:** Electricity in {{STATE_NAME}}
- You likely have one provider: {{STATE_UTILITY_PROVIDERS}}
- Price set by state utility commission (regulated monopoly)
- Your options:
  - Time-of-use plans (cheaper electricity at off-peak hours)
  - Energy efficiency (reduce consumption)
  - Solar panels (become partial producer)
  - No ability to switch providers

## Comparing Market Structures: Summary

### Pricing Power Spectrum

```
Low Prices ←——————————————————————→ High Prices
(Consumer Benefit)              (Seller Benefit)

Perfect          Monopolistic        Oligopoly        Monopoly
Competition      Competition
```

### Consumer Surplus

**Consumer Surplus = Value you get - Price you pay**

- **Perfect Competition:** Maximum consumer surplus (prices lowest possible)
- **Monopolistic Competition:** High consumer surplus (some brand premium but competition keeps prices down)
- **Oligopoly:** Moderate consumer surplus (prices higher but not maximized)
- **Monopoly:** Minimum consumer surplus (monopolist captures most surplus)

### What Determines Market Structure?

**Barriers to Entry:**
- **Low barriers** → Many firms → Perfect or monopolistic competition
- **High barriers** → Few firms → Oligopoly or monopoly

**Types of Barriers:**
1. **Capital requirements:** Need billions for telecom network
2. **Economies of scale:** Large firms produce more cheaply
3. **Government regulation:** Licenses, patents, legal restrictions
4. **Control of resources:** DeBeers controlled diamond mines
5. **Network effects:** More users = more valuable (social media, payment systems)
6. **Brand loyalty:** Established brands hard to displace

## Recognizing Market Structures in Your Life

### Exercise: Classify Your Purchases

| Purchase | Number of Sellers | Product Differentiation | Your Assessment | Market Structure |
|----------|------------------|------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Groceries** | Many stores | Some differentiation (Whole Foods vs. Walmart) | Monopolistic Competition | |
| **Gasoline** | Many stations | Identical product | Perfect Competition (locally oligopoly by brand) | |
| **Internet service** | 1-3 providers in most areas | Slightly differentiated | Oligopoly or Monopoly (location-dependent) | |
| **Smartphones** | ~3 major (Apple, Samsung, Google) | Differentiated | Oligopoly | |
| **Water service** | 1 | No substitutes | Monopoly | |
| **Fast food** | Many chains | Differentiated | Monopolistic Competition | |
| **Airlines** | ~4 major carriers | Slightly differentiated | Oligopoly | |

## Discussion Questions

1. **Why don't we see perfect competition in most markets?**
   - Product differentiation is easy (branding, location, service)
   - Some barriers always exist (capital, expertise, regulation)
   - Firms actively try to differentiate to gain pricing power

2. **Are monopolies always bad?**
   - Natural monopolies can be more efficient (one set of power lines vs. three)
   - Patents encourage innovation (20-year monopoly reward for new drugs)
   - But unregulated monopolies exploit consumers
   - Regulated monopolies are a compromise

3. **How does market structure affect innovation?**
   - Perfect competition: Little innovation (no profit margin to fund R&D)
   - Monopolistic competition: High innovation (differentiation is key to profits)
   - Oligopoly: Moderate to high (large firms can fund R&D, but less pressure)
   - Monopoly: Low (no competitive pressure), unless seeking to protect monopoly

4. **As a consumer in {{STATE_NAME}}, which market structures affect you most?**
   - Monopolies: Utilities (electricity, water)
   - Oligopolies: Phones, internet, healthcare, insurance
   - Monopolistic competition: Most retail, services, food
   - Where do you have the least power? Most power?

5. **Should government break up large companies?**
   - Arguments for: Increase competition, lower prices, more innovation
   - Arguments against: Economies of scale benefit consumers, international competitiveness
   - Case-by-case analysis needed

## Key Takeaways

✓ **Four market structures** - Perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, monopoly - differ by number of sellers and barriers to entry

✓ **Market power increases** - As you move from perfect competition to monopoly, sellers gain more pricing power and consumers lose surplus

✓ **Barriers to entry** - Determine how many firms can compete: low barriers → many firms, high barriers → few firms

✓ **Consumer strategies differ** - How you shop should depend on market structure:
- Perfect competition: Shop by price alone
- Monopolistic competition: Balance price, quality, and preferences
- Oligopoly: Compare all major players, negotiate when possible
- Monopoly: Minimize usage, seek substitutes, advocate for regulation

✓ **{{STATE_NAME}} has all four** - Your daily purchases span the full spectrum of market structures

✓ **Government role** - Regulates monopolies, enforces antitrust laws, protects consumers when competition fails

## Connection to L-48, L-49, and L-50

**L-48 (Economic Systems):**
- Market economies work best with competition (perfect or monopolistic competition)
- {{STATE_NAME}}'s mixed economy regulates monopolies and oligopolies
- Property rights + competition = efficient markets

**L-49 (Scarcity and Opportunity Cost):**
- Monopolies can create artificial scarcity (restrict output)
- Your opportunity cost as consumer: monopoly price vs. competitive price
- Sellers' opportunity cost: compete on price vs. differentiate

**L-50 (Supply and Demand):**
- Perfect competition: Supply and demand determine price
- Oligopoly/Monopoly: Seller sets price based on market power, not just S&D
- Elasticity matters more with monopolies (inelastic demand = more pricing power)

**Integration:**
Market structures show us that supply and demand (L-50) work differently depending on the level of competition. The incentives from L-49 change based on market structure. And the competitive markets from L-48 only exist when barriers to entry are low.
