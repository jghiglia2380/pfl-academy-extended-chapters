  "notes": "Florida has no state income tax, making it attractive for retirees and high earners. However, property taxes and insurance costs (especially homeowners insurance due to hurricane risk) can be high. Save Our Homes amendment caps annual assessment increases at 3% for primary residences, creating significant tax disparities between long-time residents and new buyers. State experiencing rapid population growth, particularly from New York, California, and Illinois residents seeking lower taxes. Tourism is massive industry (Disney World, beaches, cruise ports). Minimum wage gradually increasing to $15/hour by 2026. Public university system relatively affordable compared to other states. Hurricane insurance costs have risen dramatically, with some insurers leaving the market."
