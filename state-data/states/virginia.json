  "notes": "Virginia has moderate taxes and cost of living, though Northern Virginia (DC suburbs) is very expensive. State is home to many federal government employees and defense contractors, particularly in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads. Strong education system with several top public universities (UVA, William & Mary, Virginia Tech). Minimum wage $12/hour as of 2023, higher than federal but lower than many progressive states. Property taxes vary dramatically - high in Northern Virginia, moderate in urban areas, low in rural regions. State economy diverse: tech (Northern VA), military (Hampton Roads), agriculture (Shenandoah Valley), tourism (coastal areas)."
