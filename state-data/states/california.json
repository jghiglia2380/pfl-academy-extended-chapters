Housing crisis is severe with median home prices exceeding $780,000. Proposition 13 (1978) caps property tax increases at 2% annually unless property sold. State minimum wage is $16/hour (2024), highest in nation. Major tech industry presence in Silicon Valley drives high salaries but also high housing costs. Strong consumer protection laws (CCPA privacy law, auto-renewal disclosure requirements). State experiencing population decline for first time, with residents moving to lower-cost states like Texas, Arizona, Nevada."
